<p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.</p>
<p>Node.js is a very powerful JavaScript-based platform built on Google Chrome&apos;s JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications. Node.js is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.</p>
<p>React is a front-end library developed by Facebook. It is used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. ReactJS allows us to create reusable UI components. It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript libraries and has a strong foundation and large community behind it.</p>
<h1 id="javascript">Javascript</h1>
<ol>
<li><h3 id="what-is-javascript">What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p> JavaScript is a client-side as well as server side scripting language that can be inserted into HTML pages and is understood by web browsers. JavaScript is also an Object based Programming language</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="enumerate-the-differences-between-java-and-javascript">Enumerate the differences between Java and JavaScript?</h3>
<p>Java is a complete programming language. In contrast, JavaScript is a coded program that can be introduced to HTML pages. These two languages are not at all inter-dependent and are designed for the different intent. Java is an object - oriented programming (OOPS) or structured programming language like C++ or C whereas JavaScript is a client-side scripting language.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="what-are-javascript-data-types">What are JavaScript Data Types?</h3>
<p>Following are the JavaScript Data types:</p>
<p>Number
String
Boolean
Object
Undefined</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="what-is-the-use-of-isnan-function">What is the use of isNaN function?</h3>
<p>isNan function returns true if the argument is not a number otherwise it is false.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="between-javascript-and-an-asp-script-which-is-faster">Between JavaScript and an ASP script, which is faster?</h3>
<p>JavaScript is faster. JavaScript is a client-side language and thus it does not need the assistance of the web server to execute. On the other hand, ASP is a server-side language and hence is always slower than JavaScript. Javascript now is also a server side language (nodejs).</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="what-is-negative-infinity">What is negative infinity?</h3>
<p>Negative Infinity is a number in JavaScript which can be derived by dividing negative number by zero.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="is-it-possible-to-break-javascript-code-into-several-lines">Is it possible to break JavaScript Code into several lines?</h3>
<p>Breaking within a string statement can be done by the use of a backslash, &apos;\&apos;, at the end of the first line</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>document.write(&quot;This is \a program&quot;);
And if you change to a new line when not within a string statement, then javaScript ignores break in line.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var x=1, ### y=2,
z=
x+y;
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is perfectly fine, though not advisable as it hampers debugging.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="which-company-developed-javascript">Which company developed JavaScript?</h3>
<p>Netscape is the software company who developed JavaScript.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="what-are-undeclared-and-undefined-variables">What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h3>
<p>Undeclared variables are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered.</p>
<p>Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.</p>

<p>Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code, that is, these have no scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable or object. If the var keyword is omitted, a global variable is declared.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// Declare a global globalVariable = &quot;Test&quot;;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The problems that are faced by using global variables are the clash of variable names of local and global scope. Also, it is difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="what-is-a-prompt-box">What is a prompt box?</h3>
<p>A prompt box is a box which allows the user to enter input by providing a text box. Label and box will be provided to enter the text or number.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="what-is-this-keyword-in-javascript">What is &apos;this&apos; keyword in JavaScript?</h3>

<p>Timers are used to execute a piece of code at a set time or also to repeat the code in a given interval of time. This is done by using the functions setTimeout, setInterval and clearInterval.</p>
<p>The setTimeout(function, delay) function is used to start a timer that calls a particular function after the mentioned delay. The setInterval(function, delay) function is used to repeatedly execute the given function in the mentioned delay and only halts when cancelled. The clearInterval(id) function instructs the timer to stop.</p>
<p>Timers are operated within a single thread, and thus events might queue up, waiting to be executed.</p>

<pre><code>16. ### What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

    &apos;ViewState&apos; is specific to a page in a session.

    &apos;SessionState&apos; is specific to user specific data that can be accessed across all pages in the web application.

17. ### What is === operator?

    === is called as strict equality operator which returns true when the two operands are having the same value without any type conversion.

18. ### Explain how can you submit a form using JavaScript?

    To submit a form using JavaScript use document.form[0].submit();
</code></pre><pre><code>document.form[0].submit();
</code></pre><pre><code>19. ### Does JavaScript support automatic type conversion?

<ol>
<li><h3 id="how-can-you-convert-the-string-of-any-base-to-integer-in-javascript">How can you convert the string of any base to integer in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>The parseInt() function is used to convert numbers between different bases. parseInt() takes the string to be converted as its first parameter, and the second parameter is the base of the given string.</p>
<p>In order to convert 4F (of base 16) to integer, the code used will be -</p>
<p>parseInt (&quot;4F&quot;, 16);</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="explain-the-difference-between--and-">Explain the difference between == and ===?</h3>
<p>== checks only for equality in value whereas === is a stricter equality test and returns false if either the value or the type of the two variables are different.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="what-would-be-the-result-of-327">What would be the result of 3+2+&quot;7&quot;?</h3>

<pre><code>55. ### What is the &apos;Strict&apos; mode in JavaScript and how can it be enabled?

    Strict Mode adds certain compulsions to JavaScript. Under the strict mode, JavaScript shows errors for a piece of codes, which did not show an error before, but might be problematic and potentially unsafe. Strict mode also solves some mistakes that hamper the JavaScript engines to work efficiently.

    Strict mode can be enabled by adding the string literal &quot;use strict&quot; above the file. This can be illustrated by the given example:
```javascript
function myfunction() {
    &quot;use strict&quot;;
    var v = &quot;This is a strict mode function&quot;;
}

</code></pre>
</li>
<li><h3 id="explain-the-for-in-loop">Explain the for-in loop?</h3>
<p>The for-in loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.</p>
<p>The syntax for the for-in loop is -</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (variable name <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> object){

<li><h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-call-and-apply">What is the difference between .call() and .apply()?</h3>
<p>The function .call() and .apply() are very similar in their usage except a little difference. .call() is used when the number of the function&apos;s arguments are known to the programmer, as they have to be mentioned as arguments in the call statement. On the other hand, .apply() is used when the number is not known. The function .apply() expects the argument to be an array.</p>
<p>The basic difference between .call() and .apply() is in the way arguments are passed to the function. Their usage can be illustrated by the given example.
```javascript
var someObject = {
myProperty : &apos;Foo&apos;,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>myMethod : function(prefix, postfix) {</p>
<pre><code>alert(prefix + this.myProperty + postfix);
</code></pre><p>}
};
someObject.myMethod(&apos;&lt;&apos;, &apos;&gt;&apos;); // alerts &apos;<foo>&apos;
var someOtherObject  = {</foo></p>
<pre><code>myProperty : &apos;Bar&apos;
</code></pre><p>};
someObject.myMethod.call(someOtherObject, &apos;&lt;&apos;, &apos;&gt;&apos;); // alerts &apos;<bar>&apos;</bar></p>
<p>someObject.myMethod.apply(someOtherObject, [&apos;&lt;&apos;, &apos;&gt;&apos;]); // alerts &apos;<bar>&apos;</bar></p>
<pre><code>64. ### Define event bubbling?

    JavaScript allows DOM elements to be nested inside each other. In such a case, if the handler of the child is clicked, the handler of parent will also work as if it were clicked too.

65. ### Is JavaScript case sensitive? Give an example?

    Yes, JavaScript is case sensitive. For example, a function parseInt is not same as the function Parseint.

66. ### What boolean operators can be used in JavaScript?

    The &apos;And&apos; Operator (&amp;&amp;), &apos;Or&apos; Operator (||) and the &apos;Not&apos; Operator (!) can be used in JavaScript.

    *Operators are without the parenthesis.

67. ### How can a particular frame be targeted, from a hyperlink, in JavaScript?

    This can be done by including the name of the required frame in the hyperlink using the &apos;target&apos; attribute.

```html
&lt;a href=&quot;/newpage.htm&quot; target=&quot;newframe&quot;&gt;&gt;New Page&lt;/a&gt;

<li><h3 id="how-are-dom-utilized-in-javascript">How are DOM utilized in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>DOM stands for Document Object Model and is responsible for how various objects in a document interact with each other. DOM is required for developing web pages, which includes objects like paragraph, links, etc. These objects can be operated to include actions like add or delete. DOM is also required to add extra capabilities to a web page. On top of that, the use of API gives an advantage over other existing models.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="how-are-event-handlers-utilized-in-javascript">How are event handlers utilized in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>Events are the actions that result from activities, such as clicking a link or filling a form, by the user. An event handler is required to manage proper execution of all these events. Event handlers are an extra attribute of the object. This attribute includes event&apos;s name and the action taken if the event takes place.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="explain-the-role-of-deferred-scripts-in-javascript">Explain the role of deferred scripts in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>By default, the parsing of the HTML code, during page loading, is paused until the script has not stopped executing. It means, if the server is slow or the script is particularly heavy, then the webpage is displayed with a delay. While using Deferred, scripts delays execution of the script till the time HTML parser is running. This reduces the loading time of web pages and they get displayed faster.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="what-are-the-various-functional-components-in-javascript">What are the various functional components in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>The different functional components in JavaScript are-</p>
<p>First-class functions: Functions in JavaScript are utilized as first class objects. This usually means that these functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, assigned to variables or can also be stored in data structures.</p>
<p>Nested functions: The functions, which are defined inside other functions, are called Nested functions. They are called &apos;everytime&apos; the main function is invoked.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="write-about-the-errors-shown-in-javascript">Write about the errors shown in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>JavaScript gives a message if it encounters an error. The recognized errors are -</p>
<p>Load-time errors: The errors shown at the time of the page loading are counted under Load-time errors. These errors are encountered by the use of improper syntax, and thus are detected while the page is getting loaded.
Run-time errors: This is the error that comes up while the program is running. It is caused by illegal operations, for example, division of a number by zero, or trying to access a non-existent area of the memory.
Logic errors: It is caused by the use of syntactically correct code, which does not fulfill the required task. For example, an infinite loop.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="what-are-screen-objects">What are Screen objects?</h3>
<p>Screen objects are used to read the information from the client&apos;s screen. The properties of screen objects are -</p>
<p>AvailHeight: Gives the height of client&apos;s screen
AvailWidth: Gives the width of client&apos;s screen.
ColorDepth: Gives the bit depth of images on the client&apos;s screen
Height: Gives the total height of the client&apos;s screen, including the taskbar
Width: Gives the total width of the client&apos;s screen, including the taskbar</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="explain-the-unshift-method-">Explain the unshift() method ?</h3>
<p>This method is functional at the starting of the array, unlike the push(). It adds the desired number of elements to the top of an array. For example -
```javascript
var name = [ &quot;john&quot; ];
name.unshift( &quot;charlie&quot; );
name.unshift( &quot;joseph&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot; );
console.log(name);
The output is shown below:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[&quot; joseph &quot;,&quot; Jane &quot;, &quot; charlie &quot;, &quot; john &quot;]</p>
<pre><code>79. ### Define unescape() and escape() functions?

    The escape () function is responsible for coding a string so as to make the transfer of the information from one computer to the other, across a network.

    For Example:
```html
&lt;script&gt;
    document.write(escape(&quot;Hello? How are you!&quot;));
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><p>Output: Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21</p>
<p>The unescape() function is very important as it decodes the coded string.</p>
<p>It works in the following way. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript">
    <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.write(<span class="hljs-built_in">unescape</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21&quot;</span>));
</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Output: Hello? How are you!</p>
<ol>
<li><h3 id="what-are-the-decodeuri-and-encodeuri">What are the decodeURI() and encodeURI()?</h3>
<p>EncodeURl() is used to convert URL into their hex coding. And DecodeURI() is used to convert the encoded URL back to normal.</p>

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> uri=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;my test.asp?name=st&#xE5;le&amp;car=saab&quot;</span>;

<span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.write(<span class="hljs-built_in">encodeURI</span>(uri)+ <span class="hljs-string">&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;</span>);

<span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.write(<span class="hljs-built_in">decodeURI</span>(uri));
</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Output -</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>my%20test.asp?name=st%C3%A5le&amp;car=saab</p>
<p>my test.asp?name=st&#xE5;le&amp;car=saab</p>

<li><h3 id="why-it-is-not-advised-to-use-innerhtml-in-javascript">Why it is not advised to use innerHTML in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>innerHTML content is refreshed every time and thus is slower. There is no scope for validation in innerHTML and, therefore, it is easier to insert rouge code in the document and, thus, make the web page unstable.</p>

    <h1 id="nodejs"># Nodejs</h1> 
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Node.js?</h3>
<p> Node.js is a JavaScript platform/runtime built on Google Chrome&#39;s JavaScript V8 engine. This allows JavaScript to be used on machines outside of a browser and allows developers to use JavaScript to write things like command-line tools and server-side scripts.
 As a result, Node.js represents the JavaScript everywhere paradigm by unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages being used on the server and client-side.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Node.js used for?</h3>
<p> Node.js is usually used for non-blocking and event-driven servers.
 This makes it great for building things like static file servers, web application frameworks, REST APIs, messaging middleware, real-time services (chat, games, etc), command-line applications, browser games, and anything else that isn&#39;t CPU intensive or doesn&#39;t require long processing times.
 Amongst those use-cases, web applications are the most commonly used by developers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What language is Node.js written in?</h3>
<p> Node.js works by using the V8 engine to compile JavaScript into native machine code during runtime.
 In order to bind JavaScript code with the V8 engine (written in C++), most of the Node.js code is written in C++. But there are many parts of Node.js that are also written in JavaScript.
 Node.js is open-sourced, so you can check the code for yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Who was the original author/creator of Node.js? And who works on Node.js now?</h3>
<p> Node.js was initially created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and was sponsored by Joyent. Today, Node.js is maintained and built by open-source software developers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the key features of Node.js?</h3>
<p> V8
 Since Node.js compiles JavaScript to machine code using the V8 engine, it allows for high runtime performance (a.k.a it&#39;s really fast).</p>
<p> Single-Threaded Execution
 On the main thread that runs JavaScript, Node.js is single threaded (multiple threads are used under-the-hood by V8). This means Node.js is non-blocking (for the most part), where the majority of the functions (callbacks) are delegated to the event loop and executed asynchronously.</p>
<p> Asynchronous
 Multiple requests to Node.js can be handled without having any dependency on each other, which boosts both throughput and efficiency.</p>
<p> Rich Ecosystem Provided By NPM
 The default package manager for Node.js, named NPM, is a command-line utility included by default with Node.js. And it also provides a huge online repository of open-source code to choose from. NPM allows you to search, install, share, and reuse lines of code.</p>
<p> Full Stack JavaScript Development
 Node.js made it possible for developers to use JavaScript on the server-side. Now, they can use the same scripting language on both the frontend and backed when they build applications. This allows developers to build things faster and reduces the size of the learning curve for developers who are already proficient in JavaScript.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are some of the drawbacks with of Node.js?</h3>
<p> The main drawback is that it&#39;s not efficient when handling CPU-intensive tasks or any long-running operations. Examples of these types of tasks include generating audio and video or editing graphics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s the name of the JavaScript engine Node.js is built on?</h3>
<p> The V8 engine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How does the V8 engine work?</h3>
<p> V8 compiles and executes JavaScript source code into machine code, handles memory allocation for objects, and garbage collects objects it no longer needs. V8 enables any C++ application to expose its own objects and functions to JavaScript code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the event loop in Node.js?</h3>
<p> The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking Input/Output operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.</p>
<p> The main role of the event loop is to schedule which operations the single thread should be performing at any given point in time.</p>
<p> For more information on how the event loop works.</p>

</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is libuv?</h3>
<p>libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. It was primarily developed for use by Node.js, but it’s also used by Luvit, Julia, pyuv, and others.</p>
<p>It is used by the Node.js behind-the-scenes to perform I/O for network and file operations.</p>
<p>Check out the libuv documentation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How does Node.js handle child threads?</h3>
<p>Node.js is a single thread process and, by default, doesn&#39;t expose child threads and thread management to the developer. Behind the scenes, Node.js does spawn child threads for certain tasks like asynchronous Input/Output operations. But it runs in the background and doesn&#39;t execute any application JavaScript code or block the main event loop.</p>
<p>But, developers to spawn their own external child processes by using tools like the child_process module and worker threads.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?</h3>
<p>Synchronous: When you execute code synchronously, you wait for it to finish before moving to another task.
Asynchronous: When you execute code asynchronously, you can move on to another task before it finishes.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Why is asynchronous programming important in Node.js?</h3>
<p>User interfaces are asynchronous by nature, in that they spend the majority of their time waiting for the user to interrupt the event loop and trigger event handlers.</p>
<p>Therefore, Node.js is also asynchronous by default and the server works in the same way. It waits for a request from the network and can accept additional incoming requests while the first one is handled. This is very beneficial to performance on the server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you handle errors when dealing with asynchronous code?</h3>
<p>Return an Error as the First Parameter to a Callback Function
In Node.js, the standard way to handle errors in asynchronous functions is to return them as the first argument in a function&#39;s callback. If the error exists, the first parameter is passed an Error object that contains the information on the error. If there is no error, the first parameter will be null.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using this in your code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function (error, returnValue) {
if (error) {
console.log(error)
return
} else {
console.log(returnValue)
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see in the example, if there is no error, the callback returns a value of null as the first argument. If an error does exist, the first parameter returns an Error object.</p>
<p>Use a Try...Catch Statement Inside an Async/Await Function
Another way to handle errors in asynchronous code is to use an async function with a try...catch statement inside of it that will catch any errors that occur.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a code example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">async function main() {
try {
const data = await getData()
console.log(class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;data)
} catch (error) {
console.log(error)
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the code example, notice that the catch block will handle parsing errors if one occurs in the try block.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why is some code considered to be &quot;blocking&quot;?</h3>
<p>Blocking code is when the execution of additional JavaScript in the Node.js process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes. This happens because the event loop is unable to continue running JavaScript while a blocking operation is occurring.</p>
<p>Blocking methods execute synchronously and non-blocking methods execute asynchronously.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>What is process .nextTick() used for?</h3>
<p>In Node.js, each iteration of the event loop is called a tick. The process.nextTick() </p>
<p>method is used to defer the execution of a function until the next iteration in the Node.js event loop.</p>
<p>You can pass a function to the process</p>
<p>.nextTick()</p>
<p>like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">process.nextTick(() =&gt; {
// do something here
}
</code></pre>
<p>This tells the Node.js engine to call that function at the end of the current operation and before the next event loop tick starts.</p>
<p>Another way to set code to run in the next iteration of the event loop is to use the setImmediate() function.</p>
<p>The code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">setImmediate(() =&gt; {
// do something here
})
</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that a function passed to process.nextTick() is going to be executed on the current iteration of the event loop, after the current operation ends. This means that it will always execute before setImmediate().</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is event-driven programming?</h3>
<p>Event-driven programming is a paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events like user actions (clicks or keypresses) or messages from other programs. In an event-driven application, there&#39;s usually a main loop that listens for certain events and triggers a callback function when one of the events is received.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the EventEmitter in Node.js?</h3>
<p>The EventEmitter is a module that facilitates communication/interaction between objects in Node.js. Emitter objects emit named events that cause previously created listeners to be called when they detect the named event.</p>
<p>It works similar to how a pub/sub or observer design patter does.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can you create an HTTP server using Node.js? If so, can you explain the code needed to do so?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can certainly create an HTTP server using Node.js.</p>
<p>Here is what a basic HTTP server would look like using the HTTP module:
```javascript
const http = require(&quot;http&quot;)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;text/plain&quot;})
  res.write(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
  res.end()
}).listen(8080)</p>
<pre><code>  When preparing for the interview, it&#39;s unlikely that your interviewer expects you to know this code off the top of your head. But, it may be helpful to have a general idea of how one is built and be able to talk through the overall idea of a HTTP server. Being able to talk over different HTTP frameworks you&#39;ve used in your own projects may be helpful as well.



20. ### What is a control flow function? And what are the steps to execute one?

    The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. A control flow function is one that handles or modifies the sequence in which different pieces of code runs. And is often the code that runs between asynchronous function calls.

    To execute a control flow function, these steps should be followed:

    Control the order of execution.
    Collect the required data.
    Limit the concurrency.
    Invoke the next step of the program.

21. ### Does Node.js support multi-core computing platforms? Is it capable of utilizing more than one CPU core?

    A single instance of Node.js runs in a single thread. To take advantage of multi-core systems, the user will sometimes want to launch a cluster of Node.js processes to handle the load.

    The Cluster module allows you to easily create multiple child processes that all share the same server ports.

22. ### Describe what a stream is in Node.js?

    In Node.js, a stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. Streams are a way to handle network communications, reading/writing files, and any other kind of end-to-end exchange where data is being moved from one place to another.

    If you wanted to create a program that read a file, the conventional way would be to read the file into memory from start-to-finish and then process it. With streams, you can read that file piece by piece and process the file without storing the entire thing in memory.

    For example, in a Node.js based HTTP server, the request is a readable stream and the response is a writable stream. Both involve moving data from one destination to the other.

    Another example can be found with the fs module, which lets you work with both readable and writable file streams.

    The use of streams provides two key advantages:

    Uses less memory: since only chunks of data are stored in memory, you use a lot less computing resources.
    Takes less time to process data: since you can start processing the data right away (instead of waiting until all the data has been received), lots of time is saved.


23. ###  How many types of streams exist in Node.js?

    Three are four different types of streams in Node.js:

    Writable: streams to which data can be written to.
    Readable: streams from which data can be read from.
    Duplex: streams that are both Writable and Readable.
    Transform: Duplex streams that can modify the data as it&#39;s written or read.

24. ### What kind of events can be fired by a stream?

    Each type of stream in Node.js is an EventEmitter instance and can throw several types of events at different times.

    These are the commonly used ones:

    data: fired whenever data is available to be read.
    end: fired when there is no more data to be read.
    error: fired when there is an error when receiving or writing data.
    finish: fired when all the data has been flushed to the underlying system.


25. ### What&#39;s piping in Node.js?

    In Node.js, piping is used when dealing with streams. And is the name for the method used to connect a readable stream to a writeable stream. This is a common method when dealing with file streams using the stream.pipe function.


26. ### What&#39;s the purpose of the Buffer class in Node.js?

    A buffer represents a chunk of memory allocated outside of the V8 JavaScript engine. And can be thought of as an array of integers where each value represents a byte of data.

    In essence, a buffer serves as a temporary place in memory where data can be dumped and used for further processing.

    The Buffer class was introduced as part of the Node.js API to enable interaction with octet streams in TCP streams, file system operations, and other contexts.


27. ### What&#39;s the difference between readFile() and createReadStream() in Node.js?

    readFile(): the file is completely pushed into the buffer for processing and returns the response only when the entire has been pushed into the buffer and read. It uses a lot of memory and can be very slow when handling large files.
    createReadStream(): the is pushed into the buffer in chunks and each chunk is removed when it has been processed. The file is sent in chunks and once the process of one chunk is done, it sends a response and removes it from the buffer. This is more effective and memory efficient when dealing with larger files.


28. ### What general practices do you use for debugging when building Node.js applications?

    For this question, explain some debugging methods you have used in the past. These may be specific to you, but you can talk about some general topics such as these:

    The Built-In Debugger
    The Node.js debugger is a built-in way to debug an application. It exposes a debugger statement that you can place in your source code to cause your code to break at certain points. You must run your Node.js application in debug mode for this to work (node debug your-app).

    It would look similar to this in your code:

```javascript
setTimeout(() =&gt; {
  debuggerconsole.log(&quot;world&quot;)
}, 1000)

console.log(&quot;hello&quot;)
</code></pre><p>  When you run that code with the debug flag, it will expose a command-line interface that allows you to inspect your code.</p>
<p>  Node Inspector
  The Node Inspector is an NPM package that provides a debugger interface for Node.js applications.</p>
<p>  You can talk about using this tool or one of the many others for debugging.</p>
<p>  Creating Tests
  By creating extensive tests for your application, you will form a great understanding of how your application works and it will make the process of finding bugs easier when they occur.</p>
<ol>

</li>
</ol>
<p>console.log(&quot;hello&quot;)</p>
<pre><code>  When you run that code with the debug flag, it will expose a command-line interface that allows you to inspect your code.



30. ### What&#39;s the difference between programmer and operational errors?

    Operational Errors
    Operational errors are run-time problems experienced by correctly-written programs. These are not necessarily bugs in the program and are usually problems caused by something with the system itself, the system&#39;s configuration, the network, or a remote service.

    Some specific examples include:

    failed to connect to server
    ailed to resolve hostname
    server returned a 500 response
    system is out of memory
    Programmer Errors
    Programmer errors are bugs in the program and are caused by the developer. These are things that can be fixed by changing the code.



31. ### What are callbacks used for in Node.js?

    Node.js APIs make heavy use of callback functions. A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function that will be called when the function ends. It is an asynchronous equivalent for a function and is called at the completion of a given task.



32. ### What is the first argument passed to a Node.js callback function?

    The error object.

    If an error occurred, it will be returned by the first error argument. And the second argument of the callback is usually reserved for successful response data.



33. ### What is a Promise?

    A promise is an object that may produce a single value at some point in the future and represents the result of an asynchronous function. That value can be either a resolved value or a reason for why it wasn&#39;t resolved (an error).

    A promise can be in three different states:

    pending
    fulfilled
    rejected
    Callbacks can be attached to the promise to handle the fulfilled value or any rejection reasons.


34. ### What is an async function? Why is it used?
    An aync function is one that operates asynchronously via the event loop and uses a Promise to return its result. These are declared using the async function syntax.

    An async function can use the await expression to pause the execution of the asynchronous function and wait for the Promise to resolve (only the async function block waits, not the execution thread). Then it resumes the async function&#39;s execution and evaluates as the resolved value.

    Here&#39;s an example of what one looks like in code:

```javascript
async function main() {
  try {
    const data = await getData()
    console.log(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
  }
}
</code></pre><pre><code>The purpose of an async function is to enable developers to write promise-based code as if it were synchronous, but without blocking the execution thread.
</code></pre><ol>
<li><h3>What is callback hell?</h3>
<p>Callback hell is a JavaScript anti-pattern caused by deeply nested asynchronous functions. Callback hell happens when you have callbacks within callbacks within callbacks and your code becomes difficult if not impossible to reason about.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you prevent or fix callback hell?</h3>
<p>The most important way to avoid callback hell is to move functions out of the way so that the program can be more easily understand without wading through miles of functions and their callbacks.</p>
<p>Here are some other methods of preventing callback hell are:</p>
<p>Don&#39;t nest functions, give them names, and place them at the top of your program.
Utilize function hoisting to move functions out of the way.
Handle every error in each of your callbacks.
Modularize your code by creating reusable functions and placing them in their own module.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is NPM?</h3>
<p>NPM is the default package manager for Node.js and servers as the world&#39;s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What functionalities does NPM provide when building Node.js applications?</h3>
<p>NPM consists of a command-line client and an online database of public and paid private packages called the NPM registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the NPM website.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s the difference between NPM packages and Node.js core modules?</h3>
<p>Node.js core modules provide the bare minimum functionalities of Node.js. They are compiled into the binary distribution of Node.js and load automatically when the Node.js process starts. Therefore, they can be imported directly into your Node.js code without installing anything.</p>
<p>On the other hand, NPM packages is code that can be imported into a Node.js application via the NPM registry. These need to be installed via the NPM command-line utility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is a global installation of a NPM dependency?</h3>
<p>An NPM dependency that is installed globally on your machine will be stored in a single place in the system, no matter where you run the installation script. The destination for the packages will depend on your OS, deployment, or configuration settings.</p>
<p>But, you won&#39;t be able to import global packages into a Node.js application directly.</p>
<p>You can install Node.js packages globally by adding the -g flag to the npm install command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is a local dependency of a NPM dependency?</h3>
<p>NPM packages installed locally will be installed to the node_modules directory for a given Node.js application. These packages can be imported directly into the Node.js application it was installed for.</p>
<p>This is the default behavior for installing NPM packages and, therefore, you don&#39;t need to add any flags to the npm install command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you update NPM to a new version in Node.js?</h3>
<p>You can update NPM to the latest version by using this command: npm install -g npm@latest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the most popular alternative to NPM? What are its benefits?</h3>
<p>Yarn is a popular alternative to NPM.</p>
<p>Many have reported that Yarn provides much faster installation times compared to NPM due to it&#39;s caching mechanisms. And it also makes security a core value by using checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s a package.json file? And what is it used for?</h3>
<p>The package.json file holds the various metadata relevant to a Node.js project. It gives information to NPM that allows it to identify the project as well as handle its dependencies.</p>
<p>It can also hold other types of metadata such as a project description, the version of the project, license information, and even configuration data. It is usually stored in the root directory of a Node.js application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s a package-lock.json file? And why is it used?</h3>
<p>The package-lock.json file is automatically generated for any operations where NPM modifies either the node_modules directory or the package.json file. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs can generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.</p>
<p>It serves several purposes:</p>
<p>Ensures that teammates, deployments, and continuous integration are guaranteed to install exactly the same dependencies.
Provides a facility for users to &quot;time-travel&quot; to previous states of node_modules without having to commit the directory itself.
Facilitates more visibility to tree changes through readable source control diffs.
Optimizes the installation process by allowing NPM to skip repeated metadata resolutions for previously-installed packages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you update a dependency using NPM?</h3>
<p>You can update one or multiple NPM dependencies using the npm update app-name command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s the difference between a dependency and a devDependency in the package.json file?</h3>
<p>The devDependencies are modules that are only required during the development process. And dependencies are modules that are required at runtime.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are exit codes in Node.js?</h3>
<p>Node.js will normally exit with a 0 status code when no more async operations are pending. There are other codes used in different circumstances.</p>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<p>1 - Uncaught Fatal Exception: There was an uncaught exception, and it was not handled by a domain or an event handler.
3 - Internal JavaScript Parse Error: The JavaScript source code internal in Node&#39;s bootstrapping process caused a parse error.
4 - Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure: The JavaScript source code internal in Node&#39;s bootstrapping process failed to return a function value when evaluated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is REPL in Node.js?</h3>
<p>Node.js comes with a virtual machine called REPL, which is also called the Node shell. REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop and the virtual environment can be used as a quick and easy way to test simple Node.js code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why is it important to maintain a consistent coding style across a Node.js project?</h3>
<p>Inconsistent code can cause problems if your code is very interconnected with legacy code or if it&#39;s part of a much large library. And it could also cause problems if a lot of people work on your codebase and, therefore, many different people need to understand it and work on it.</p>
<p>Maintaining a consistent coding styling will help mitigate any of those potential problems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What tools can be used to assure it?</h3>
<p>You can use JavaScript IDE&#39;s like VS Code that will help you format your code by default. And you can also use packages like ESLint that let you configure a set of formatting rules for your code and enforces them during testing and deployment processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What purpose does a .env file serve?</h3>
<p>The .env file is used for storing any environment variables used for a Node.js project.</p>
<p>Environment variables are used to store sensitive information like API keys and passwords and can be used to easily handle those variables globally across an entire Node.js application.</p>
<p>The .env file is usually stored in the root directory for an application and shouldn&#39;t be committed to the source code repository because it often contains sensitive information like passwords and usernames.</p>
<p>In order to use the variables declared in the .env file, you&#39;ll need to use some type of loader. We have an article that goes over how to do that.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the differences between the setTimeout() &amp; setInterval() functions?</h3>
<p>setTimeout()
The setTimeout() function lets you run a function once after an interval of time has elapsed (specified by the developer).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a code example:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">setTimeout(() =&gt; {
  console.log(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
}, 1000)
</code></pre>
<p>  The message will be logged after the 1000 milliseconds time interval has elapsed.</p>
<p>  setInterval()
  The setInterval() function lets you run a function repeatedly, starting after an interval of time has elapsed (specified by the developer), and then repeating continuously at that interval.</p>
<p>  Here&#39;s a code example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">setInterval(() =&gt; {
  console.log(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
}, 5000)
</code></pre>
<p>  This will first wait for 5000 milliseconds and then log the message after every subsequent 5000 milliseconds have passed.</p>
<p>  It&#39;s dangerous to use the setTimeout() function for shorter time periods. You should only use it for longer periods to avoid getting backed up.</p>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you create a directory using Node.js?</h3>
<p>Node.js has an Fs core module that provides an fs.mkdir() function that makes creating a new directory or folder an easy process.</p>
<p>The code would look something like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const fs = require(&quot;fs&quot;)
fs.mkdir(&quot;./new-directory-name&quot;, class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    console.log(&quot;New directory successfully created.&quot;)
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>  That function would result in a new directory called new-directory-name being created.</p>
<p>  It&#39;s also worth noting that fs.mkdir() doesn&#39;t create nested or dependent directories in it&#39;s default state.</p>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you delete a directory?</h3>
<p>Node.js has an Fs core module that provides an fs.rmdir() function that allows you to delete an empty directory.</p>
<p>If you want to delete a directory that contains files or other sub-directories, you&#39;ll need to recursively go through and remove all the individual files first. There are NPM packages that handle this for you, such as rimraf.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How would you read the contents of a directory?</h3>
<p>Node.js has an Fs core module that provides an rgb(65, 66, 69);&quot;&gt;fs.readdir() function that makes it easy to read the contents of a specified directory.</p>
<p>It would be used in your code like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const path = require(&quot;path&quot;)
const fs = require(&quot;fs&quot;)

const directoryPath = path.join(__dirname, &quot;files&quot;)

fs.readdir(directoryPath, function(err, files) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(&quot;Error getting directory information.&quot;)
  } else {
    files.forEach(function(file) {
      console.log(file)
    })
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>  The results will be both files and directories, so you&#39;ll need fs.stat() to differentiate between which is which.</p>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the preferred method of solving unhandled exceptions in Node.js?</h3>
<p>Process is a global object that provides information about the current Node.js process that is being used by your application. And it is also a listener function that listens for certain events to occur.</p>
<p>Some of those events include:</p>
<p>exit
disconnect
uncaughtException
rejectionHandled
You can write your own code to detect when the unhandledException event has been fired and handle the error safely:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class=&quot;ql-syntax&quot; spellcheck=&quot;false&quot;&gt;process.on(&quot;uncaughtException&quot;, function(err) {
// handle the errorconsole.log(err)
})
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can you name some programming paradigms that are important for Node.js developers?</h3>
<p>Four important programming paradigms:</p>
<p>Functional Programming
Object-Oriented Programming
Procedural Programming
Imperative Programming</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Can you describe what functional programming is?</h3>
<p>Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you structure your code using mostly functions. These functions take inputs (called arguments) and show the output based on those inputs provided to the function.</p>
<p>It also doesn&#39;t allow any mutation or shared state and the functions are intended to stay pure to their expression and avoid side-effects.</p>
<p>Examples of functional programming languages include Lisp, Haskell, Erlang, Clojure, and Elm.</p>
<p>Some features of the functional programming paradigm include first-class citizen functions, higher-order functions, and function composition.</p>
<p>The main benefit of using functional programming is that it doesn&#39;t involve a lot of side-effects and is immutable, which reduces the chances that your code will create hard to track down bugs. And your code will be more clean, straightforward, and succinct.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is object-oriented programming?</h3>
<p>Object-oriented programming is a coding paradigm where you use objects to model real-world things that you want to represent inside your application. And it provides a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the pros and cons between these two paradigms: functional programming and object-oriented programming?</h3>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming
Pros:</p>
<p>The basic concepts behind objects and method calls are easy to understand for developers.
The imperative style (rather than declarative) reads like a more straight forward set of instructions for the computer to follow.
Cons:</p>
<p>Objects and behaviors are tacked together to the same entity and often use a shared state. This means they can be accessed at random by other functions in a non-deterministic order, which could lead to undesirable behavior such as race conditions.
Functional Programming
Pros:</p>
<p>In the functional paradigm, sharing state and/or side-effects is avoided. This eliminates the potential for bugs to arise from the same functions using the same resources.
Programs that use pure functions are typically easier to scale to multiple additional processors or across distributed clusters without race condition or threading resource issues.
Functional programming usually uses the declarative style, which does not give step-by-step instructions for operations. They instead focus on what to do and let the underlying functions figure out how to do it. This leaves a lot of room for refactoring and performance optimization.
Cons:</p>
<p>Using functional programming styles in your code too much can potentially lead to reduced readability because the resulting code is often abstract, more terse, and less concrete.
More people are familiar with the object-oriented programming style, so common ideas in functional programming may be confusing to new teammates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is a pure function?</h3>
<p>Pure functions don&#39;t produce any side-effects and can&#39;t alter any state external from itself. Given the same input, they should always return the same output.</p>
<p>Not every function can be pure, but its often a good choice when they can be.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is function composition?</h3>
<p>Function composition is the process of combining more than one function to produce a new function.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s the difference between the two types of inheritance: prototypal &amp; classical?</h3>
<p>Classical Inheritance
These inherent from a class and create sub-class relationships called hierarchical class taxonomies. Instances are usually created using a constructor function with the new keyword.</p>
<p>Class inheritance might or might not use the class keyword from ES6.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that classical syntax in JavaScript serves as mostly sugar over prototypal inheritance, which is what&#39;s actually used in practice for JavaScript. This is because deeply nested heirarchies over large sets of object/class syntax can have negative effects on performance.</p>
<p>Prototypal Inheritance
These inherit directly from another object and are usually created using factory functions or the Object.create() method. Instances can be composed of many different methods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is a Closure?</h3>
<p>A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.</p>
<p>Closures are important because they control what is and isn’t in scope in a particular function, along with which variables are shared between sibling functions in the same containing scope. Understanding how variables and functions relate to each other is important in understanding how your code works.</p>
<p>You can use a closure by defining a function inside another one and then expose it by returning or passing it to another function. The inner function will then have access to the variables in the outer function scope.</p>
<p>Starting with the release of ES6, you can now create a closure with loops and objects where let and const are scope to the closure. Here&#39;s an article on the subject.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are some common uses for closures?</h3>
<p>Closures are useful because they let you associate data with a function that operates on that data. This has obvious parallels to object-oriented programming, where objects allow us to associate some data (the object&#39;s properties) with one or more methods.</p>
<p>Some use cases for closures include event handlers, callbacks, intervals, timeouts, and keeping variables private within a given function.</p>
<p>Closures have the chance of causing an over-consumption of memory and/or memory leaks if they&#39;re not handled correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s Git used for?</h3>
<p>Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system.</p>
<p>In other words, it&#39;s an application that keeps track of your code and all the changes that have been made to it in the past. Also, it allows you to share your code with others and collaborate on it without overwriting each other&#39;s changes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s a reverse proxy?</h3>
<p>A reverse proxy is a type of web server that takes requests, forwards them to another HTTP server somewhere else, receives a reply, and then forwards the data to the original requestor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the benefits of using a reverse-proxy (with Nginx or Apache) for a Node.js application?</h3>
<p>There are several benefits:</p>
<p>SSL termination: Handling SSL termination (changing HTTP to HTTPS) directly in your Node.js app can be tedious and expose security risks. When only a reverse proxy is allowed to perform SSL termination, only the reverse proxy has access to the SSL certificate. Without a reverse proxy, all the code in your application (including 3rd party modules) will have access to your certificates.</p>
<p>Clustering: Node.js comes with it&#39;s built-in Cluster modules which can run applications on more than one process. But using software like Nginx to run a reverse proxy is often more efficient and uses less cache than a Node.js solution.</p>
<p>Gzip compression: Off-loading gzip compression from your application to the reverse proxy can allow you to have the same compression logic at the organization level, instead of having to configure it for each application.</p>
<p>Performance benefits: SSL encryption, clustering, and gzip compression are high CPU-bound operations. Dedicated reverse proxy tools (like Nginx) usually perform those tasks faster than Node.js.</p>
<p>Simplified application code: Using a reverse proxy allows your application to focus on business logic and not about protocols and process management. As a result, your code will be simplified greatly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s the difference between SQL &amp; NoSQL databases?</h3>
<p>SQL: a relational database management system, is vertical scalable, has fixed schema, is not suitable for hierarchical data storage, and can be used for complex queries.
NoSQL: a distributed database management system, horizontally scalable, has a dynamic schema, is best suitable for hierarchical data storage, and is not good for complex queries.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>What&#39;s the difference between declaring a variable with const, var, or let?</h3>
<p>let: means the variable may be reassigned (used for things like a counter in a loop or a value swap in an algorithm).
const: means that the identifier can&#39;t and won&#39;t be reassigned.
var: means that the variable may or may not be reassigned and it may or may not be used for an entire function</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What&#39;s the difference between the null, undefined, and undeclared variable values?</h3>
<p>null: is a value of a variable and is a type of object.
undefined: is a variable that has been declared but no value exists for it.
undeclared: is a variable that has been declared without the var, let, or const keyword.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>What are some of the most popular Node.js packages you know of?</h3>
<p>This answer can be unique to what you&#39;ve used in the applications you&#39;ve built. But below are some ideas for what you could respond with:</p>
<p>Express: A Node.js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. It is the standard server framework for node.js.</p>
<p>Request: Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make HTTP calls.</p>
<p>Browserify: Browserify lets you require(&quot;modules&quot;) in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies.</p>
<p>PM2: PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks.</p>
<p>Cheerio: A fast, flexible, and lean implementation of JQuery designed for use on the server.</p>
<p>Passport: Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped into any Express-based web application.
Nodemailer: Makes it easy to send emails from Node.js.</p>

<li><h3>What&#39;s the purpose of the console object?</h3>
<p>In Node.js, console is a global object used for printing different levels of messages to stdout and stderr. It also includes built-in ways to print informational, warning, and error messages.</p>
<p>Here are the two most used methods provided by the console object and their key differences:</p>
<p>console.log(): writes to stdout, buffered, and asynchronous
console.error(): writes to stderr, synchronous, and blocking
Here&#39;s some code examples for both:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">console.log(&quot;Hello&quot;)
// Prints: Hello, to stdoutconsole.error(new Error(&quot;Error occurred!&quot;))
// Prints: [Error: Error occurred!], to stderr
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of module.exports in Node.js?</h3>
<p>The module.exports takes a JavaScript code file and exposes it to other files so they can import those functions or variables. Whatever variable or function you assign with module.exports or </p>
<p>exports will be exposed as a module for other files.</p>
</li>

<li><h3>How would you describe a monolithic application architecture?</h3>
<p>A monolithic architecture means an app is built as one cohesive unit of code that has components that are designed to work together and share the same resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How would you describe a microservice application architecture?</h3>
<p>A microservice architecture means an app is made up of lots of smaller, independent applications capable of running with their own resources and can scale independently from each other across multiple machines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the pros and cons between a microservice and monolithic architecture?</h3>
<p>Monolithic
Pros:</p>
<p>When everything is running through the same application, it&#39;s easy to hook up components to those cross-cutting concerns.
Shared-memory access is faster than inter-process communication, therefore there can be performance advantages.</p>
<p>Cons:
These applications tend to get entangled as the application evolves, which makes it hard to isolate different services.
Monolithic architectures become harder to understand the larger they get because of dependencies, side-effects, and magic that are now obvious unless you look at a specific part of the codebase.</p>
<p>Microservice
Pros:
Since each service is modularized and has its own specific job, microservice architectures are usually organized better.
They can result in better performance because you can isolate specific services and scale them individually from the rest of the application.</p>
<p>Cons:
Testing can be difficult since each service is running in its own environment.
Deployment complexity will be increased and the operational cost of deploying and managing the multiple services and systems will be increased as well.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Walk us through an application you&#39;ve built?</h3>
<p>Be prepared to walk-through an application you&#39;ve listed on your resume. Make sure you can talk about the following:</p>
<p>The technologies you used to build the application (packages, testing frameworks, etc).
If you were part of a team, what role you had in building the application.
Explain both what design decisions you made and why they were made.</p>

<h1>Reactjs</h1>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is React?</h3>
<p> React is an <strong>open-source frontend JavaScript library</strong> which is used for building user interfaces especially for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by <a href="https://github.com/jordwalke">Jordan Walke</a>, a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook&#39;s News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the major features of React?</h3>
<p> The major features of React are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses <strong>VirtualDOM</strong> instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.</li>
<li>Supports <strong>server-side rendering</strong>.</li>
<li>Follows <strong>Unidirectional</strong> data flow or data binding.</li>
<li>Uses <strong>reusable/composable</strong> UI components to develop the view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is JSX?</h3>
<p> <em>JSX</em> is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for <em>JavaScript XML</em>). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the <code>React.createElement()</code> function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.</p>
<p> In the example below text inside <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 class App extends React.Component {
   render() {</p>
<pre><code> return(
   &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;h1&gt;{&#39;Welcome to React world!&#39;}&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
 )
</code></pre><p>   }
 }
 ```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between Element and Component?</h3>
<p> An <em>Element</em> is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. <em>Elements</em> can contain other <em>Elements</em> in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.</p>
<p> The object representation of React Element would be as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> const element = React.createElement(
   &#39;div&#39;,
   {id: &#39;login-btn&#39;},
   &#39;Login&#39;
 )
</code></pre>
<p> The above <code>React.createElement()</code> function returns an object:</p>
<pre><code> {
   type: &#39;div&#39;,
   props: {
     children: &#39;Login&#39;,
     id: &#39;login-btn&#39;
   }
 }
</code></pre><p> And finally it renders to the DOM using <code>ReactDOM.render()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"> &lt;div id=&#39;login-btn&#39;&gt;Login&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p> Whereas a <strong>component</strong> can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a <code>render()</code> method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> const Button = ({ onLogin }) =&gt;
   &lt;div id={&#39;login-btn&#39;} onClick={onLogin}&gt;Login&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p> Then JSX gets transpiled to a <code>React.createElement()</code> function tree:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> const Button = ({ onLogin }) =&gt; React.createElement(
   &#39;div&#39;,
   { id: &#39;login-btn&#39;, onClick: onLogin },
   &#39;Login&#39;
 )
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to create components in React?</h3>
<p> There are two possible ways to create a component.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Function Components:</strong> This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as first parameter and return React elements:</p>
<p> <code>``jsx harmony
 function Greeting({ message }) {
   return &lt;h1&gt;{</code>Hello, ${message}`}&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p> }
 ```</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Class Components:</strong> You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as:</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 class Greeting extends React.Component {
   render() {</p>
<pre><code> return &lt;h1&gt;{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre><p>   }
 }
 ```</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?</h3>
<p> If the component needs <em>state or lifecycle methods</em> then use class component otherwise use function component.
 <em>However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle  methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are Pure Components?</h3>
<p> <em><code>React.PureComponent</code></em> is exactly the same as <em><code>React.Component</code></em> except that it handles the <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> method for you. When props or state changes, <em>PureComponent</em> will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. <em>Component</em> on the other hand won&#39;t compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> is called.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is state in React?</h3>
<p> <em>State</em> of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.</p>
<p> Let&#39;s create an user component with message state,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>```jsx harmony
class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      message: &#39;Welcome to React world&#39;
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{this.state.message}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
}
```


State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component. i.e, It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.
</code></pre><ol>
<li><h3>What are props in React?</h3>
<p> <em>Props</em> are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.</p>
<p> The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pass custom data to your component.</li>
<li>Trigger state changes.</li>
<li><p>Use via <code>this.props.reactProp</code> inside component&#39;s <code>render()</code> method.</p>
<p>For example, let us create an element with <code>reactProp</code> property:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
<Element reactProp={'1'} /></p>
<pre><code>
This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React&#39;s native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.
</code></pre><p>props.reactProp
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between state and props?</h3>
<p>Both <em>props</em> and <em>state</em> are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why should we not update the state directly?</h3>
<p>If you try to update state directly then it won&#39;t re-render the component.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">//Wrong
this.state.message = &#39;Hello world&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>Instead use <code>setState()</code> method. It schedules an update to a component&#39;s state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">//Correct
this.setState({ message: &#39;Hello World&#39; })
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can directly assign to the state object either in <em>constructor</em> or using latest javascript&#39;s class field declaration syntax.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of <code>setState()</code>?</h3>
<p>The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since <code>setState()</code> is <strong>asynchronous</strong> the callback function is used for any post action.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">setState({ name: &#39;John&#39; }, () =&gt; console.log(&#39;The name has updated and component re-rendered&#39;))
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?</h3>
<p>Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In HTML, the event name should be in <em>lowercase</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"> &lt;button onclick=&#39;activateLasers()&#39;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas in React it follows <em>camelCase</em> convention:</p>
<p> <code>jsx harmony
 &lt;button onClick={activateLasers}&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>In HTML, you can return <code>false</code> to prevent default behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"> &lt;a href=&#39;#&#39; onclick=&#39;console.log(&quot;The link was clicked.&quot;); return false;&#39; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas in React you must call <code>preventDefault()</code> explicitly:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> function handleClick(event) {
   event.preventDefault()
   console.log(&#39;The link was clicked.&#39;)
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending <code>()</code>
Whereas in react you should not append <code>()</code> with the function name. (refer &quot;activateLasers&quot; function in the first point for example)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?</h3>
<p>There are 3 possible ways to achieve this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Binding in Constructor:</strong> In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class Component extends React.Component {
constructor(props) {
  super(props)
  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
}

handleClick() {
  // ...
}
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Public class fields syntax:</strong> If you don&#39;t like to use bind approach then <em>public class fields syntax</em> can be used to correctly bind callbacks.</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 handleClick = () =&gt; {
   console.log(&#39;this is:&#39;, this)
 }</p>
<pre><code>
 ```jsx harmony
 &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;
   {&#39;Click me&#39;}
 &lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Arrow functions in callbacks:</strong> You can use <em>arrow functions</em> directly in the callbacks.</p>
<p> <code>jsx harmony
 &lt;button onClick={(event) =&gt; this.handleClick(event)}&gt;
   {&#39;Click me&#39;}
 &lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with <code>.bind()</code> or <em>public class fields syntax</em> approach considering performance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?</h3>
<p>You can use an <em>arrow function</em> to wrap around an <em>event handler</em> and pass parameters:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
<button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} /&gt;</p>
<pre><code>
This is an equivalent to calling `.bind`:

```jsx harmony
&lt;button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} /&gt;
</code></pre><p>Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as arrow function
```jsx harmony
<button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} />
handleClick = (id) =&gt; () =&gt; {</p>
<pre><code>console.log(&quot;Hello, your ticket number is&quot;, id)
</code></pre><p>};
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are synthetic events in React?</h3>
<p><code>SyntheticEvent</code> is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser&#39;s native event. It&#39;s API is same as the browser&#39;s native event, including <code>stopPropagation()</code> and <code>preventDefault()</code>, except the events work identically across all browsers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are inline conditional expressions?</h3>
<p>You can use either <em>if statements</em> or <em>ternary expressions</em> which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
<h1>Hello!</h1>
{</p>
<pre><code>messages.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; !isLogin?
  &lt;h2&gt;
      You have {messages.length} unread messages.
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  :
  &lt;h2&gt;
      You don&#39;t have unread messages.
  &lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre><p>}
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is &quot;key&quot; prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?</h3>
<p>A <code>key</code> is a special string attribute you <strong>should</strong> include when creating arrays of elements. <em>Key</em> prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.</p>
<p>Most often we use ID from our data as <em>key</em>:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =&gt;
  <li key={todo.id}></p>
<pre><code>{todo.text}
</code></pre><p>  &lt;/li&gt;
)</p>
<pre><code>
When you don&#39;t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item *index* as a *key* as a last resort:

```jsx harmony
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =&gt;
  &lt;li key={index}&gt;
    {todo.text}
  &lt;/li&gt;
)
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Using <em>indexes</em> for <em>keys</em> is <strong>not recommended</strong> if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.</li>
<li>If you extract list item as separate component then apply <em>keys</em> on list component instead of <code>li</code> tag.</li>
<li>There will be a warning message in the console if the <code>key</code> prop is not present on list items.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the use of refs?</h3>
<p>The <em>ref</em> is used to return a reference to the element. They <em>should be avoided</em> in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to create refs?</h3>
<p>There are two approaches</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This is a recently added approach. <em>Refs</em> are created using <code>React.createRef()</code> method and attached to React elements via the <code>ref</code> attribute. In order to use <em>refs</em> throughout the component, just assign the <em>ref</em> to the instance property within constructor.</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 class MyComponent extends React.Component {
   constructor(props) {</p>
<pre><code> super(props)
 this.myRef = React.createRef()
</code></pre><p>   }
   render() {</p>
<pre><code> return &lt;div ref={this.myRef} /&gt;
</code></pre><p>   }
 }
 ```</p>
</li>
<li>You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component&#39;s input element accessed as follows,
 ```jsx harmony
 class SearchBar extends Component {<pre><code>constructor(props) {
   super(props);
   this.txtSearch = null;
   this.state = { term: &#39;&#39; };
   this.setInputSearchRef = e =&gt; {
      this.txtSearch = e;
   }
}
onInputChange(event) {
   this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });
}
render() {
   return (
      &lt;input
         value={this.state.term}
         onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}
         ref={this.setInputSearchRef} /&gt;
   );
}
</code></pre> }
 ```</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also use <em>refs</em> in function components using <strong>closures</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong>: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are forward refs?</h3>
<p><em>Ref forwarding</em> is a feature that lets some components take a <em>ref</em> they receive, and pass it further down to a child.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
const ButtonElement = React.forwardRef((props, ref) =&gt; (
  <button ref={ref} className="CustomButton"></p>
<pre><code>{props.children}
</code></pre><p>  &lt;/button&gt;
));</p>
<p>// Create ref to the DOM button:
const ref = React.createRef();
<ButtonElement ref={ref}>{&#39;Forward Ref&#39;}</ButtonElement>
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Which is preferred option with in callback refs and findDOMNode()?</h3>
<p>It is preferred to use <em>callback refs</em> over <code>findDOMNode()</code> API. Because <code>findDOMNode()</code> prevents certain improvements in React in the future.</p>
<p>The <strong>legacy</strong> approach of using <code>findDOMNode</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView()
  }

  render() {
    return &lt;div /&gt;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The recommended approach is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.node = createRef();
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.node.current.scrollIntoView();
  }

  render() {
    return &lt;div ref={this.node} /&gt;
  }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why are String Refs legacy?</h3>
<p>If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the <code>ref</code> attribute is a string, like <code>ref={&#39;textInput&#39;}</code>, and the DOM node is accessed as <code>this.refs.textInput</code>. We advise against it because <em>string refs have below issues</em>, and are considered legacy. String refs were <strong>removed in React v16</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>They <em>force React to keep track of currently executing component</em>. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.</li>
<li>They are <em>not composable</em> — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can&#39;t put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.</li>
<li>They <em>don&#39;t work with static analysis</em> like Flow. Flow can&#39;t guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on <code>this.refs</code>, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.</li>
<li><p>It doesn&#39;t work as most people would expect with the &quot;render callback&quot; pattern (e.g. <DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />)
```jsx harmony
class MyComponent extends Component {
  renderRow = (index) =&gt; {</p>
<pre><code>// This won&#39;t work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent:
return &lt;input ref={&#39;input-&#39; + index} /&gt;;

// This would work though! Callback refs are awesome.
return &lt;input ref={input =&gt; this[&#39;input-&#39; + index] = input} /&gt;;
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  render() {</p>
<pre><code>return &lt;DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} /&gt;
</code></pre><p>  }
}
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Virtual DOM?</h3>
<p>The <em>Virtual DOM</em> (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of <em>Real DOM</em>. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the &quot;real&quot; DOM. It&#39;s a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called <em>reconciliation</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How Virtual DOM works?</h3>
<p>The <em>Virtual DOM</em> works in three simple steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>2. Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.


3. Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed.
</code></pre><ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM?</h3>
<p>The <em>Shadow DOM</em> is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in <em>web components</em>. The <em>Virtual DOM</em> is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is React Fiber?</h3>
<p>Fiber is the new <em>reconciliation</em> engine or reimplementation of core algorithm in React v16. The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, gestures, ability to pause, abort, or reuse work and assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the main goal of React Fiber?</h3>
<p>The goal of <em>React Fiber</em> is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is <strong>incremental rendering</strong>: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are controlled components?</h3>
<p>A component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called <strong>Controlled Component</strong>, i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.</p>
<p>For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">handleChange(event) {
  this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()})
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are uncontrolled components?</h3>
<p>The <strong>Uncontrolled Components</strong> are the ones that store their own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.</p>
<p>In the below UserProfile component, the <code>name</code> input is accessed using ref.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
class UserProfile extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {</p>
<pre><code>super(props)
this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)
this.input = React.createRef()
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  handleSubmit(event) {</p>
<pre><code>alert(&#39;A name was submitted: &#39; + this.input.current.value)
event.preventDefault()
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  render() {</p>
<pre><code>return (
  &lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;
      {&#39;Name:&#39;}
      &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; ref={this.input} /&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
);
</code></pre><p>  }
}
```</p>
<p>In most cases, it&#39;s recommend to use controlled components to implement forms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between createElement and cloneElement?</h3>
<p>JSX elements will be transpiled to <code>React.createElement()</code> functions to create React elements which are going to be used for the object representation of UI. Whereas <code>cloneElement</code> is used to clone an element and pass it new props.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Lifting State Up in React?</h3>
<p>When several components need to share the same changing data then it is recommended to <em>lift the shared state up</em> to their closest common ancestor. That means if two child components share the same data from its parent, then move the state to parent instead of maintaining local state in both of the child components.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the different phases of component lifecycle?</h3>
<p>The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mounting:</strong> The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from <code>constructor()</code>, <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code>, <code>render()</code>, and <code>componentDidMount()</code> lifecycle methods.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Updating:</strong> In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from <code>setState()</code> or <code>forceUpdate()</code>. This phase covers <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code>, <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code>, <code>render()</code>, <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</code> and <code>componentDidUpdate()</code> lifecycle methods.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Unmounting:</strong> In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes <code>componentWillUnmount()</code> lifecycle method.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Render</strong> The component will render without any side-effects. This applies for Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-commit</strong> Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Commit</strong> React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively <code>componentDidMount()</code> for mounting, <code>componentDidUpdate()</code> for updating, and <code>componentWillUnmount()</code> for unmounting.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the lifecycle methods of React?</h3>
<p>Before React 16.3</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>componentWillMount:</strong> Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.</li>
<li><strong>componentDidMount:</strong> Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.</li>
<li><strong>componentWillReceiveProps:</strong> Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.</li>
<li><strong>shouldComponentUpdate:</strong> Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns <code>true</code>. If you are sure that the component doesn&#39;t need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.</li>
<li><strong>componentWillUpdate:</strong> Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props &amp; state changes confirmed by <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> which returns true.</li>
<li><strong>componentDidUpdate:</strong> Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.</li>
<li><strong>componentWillUnmount:</strong> It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.</li>
</ul>
<p>React 16.3+</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>getDerivedStateFromProps:</strong> Invoked right before calling <code>render()</code> and is invoked on <em>every</em> render. This exists for rare use cases where you need derived state. Worth reading <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html">if you need derived state</a>.</li>
<li><strong>componentDidMount:</strong> Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.</li>
<li><strong>shouldComponentUpdate:</strong> Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns <code>true</code>. If you are sure that the component doesn&#39;t need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.</li>
<li><strong>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:</strong> Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into <code>componentDidUpdate()</code>. This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.</li>
<li><strong>componentDidUpdate:</strong> Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> returns <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><strong>componentWillUnmount</strong> It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are Higher-Order Components?</h3>
<p>A <em>higher-order component</em> (<em>HOC</em>) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it&#39;s a pattern that is derived from React&#39;s compositional nature.</p>
<p>We call them <strong>pure components</strong> because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won&#39;t modify or copy any behavior from their input components.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)
</code></pre>
<p>HOC can be used for many use cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.</li>
<li>Render hijacking.</li>
<li>State abstraction and manipulation.</li>
<li>Props manipulation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to create props proxy for HOC component?</h3>
<p>You can add/edit props passed to the component using <em>props proxy</em> pattern like this:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
function HOC(WrappedComponent) {
  return class Test extends Component {</p>
<pre><code>render() {
  const newProps = {
    title: &#39;New Header&#39;,
    footer: false,
    showFeatureX: false,
    showFeatureY: true
  }

  return &lt;WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} /&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>  }
}
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is context?</h3>
<p><em>Context</em> provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.</p>
<p>For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is children prop?</h3>
<p><em>Children</em> is a prop (<code>this.props.children</code>) that allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. Component tree put between component&#39;s opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as <code>children</code> prop.</p>
<p>There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include <code>React.Children.map</code>, <code>React.Children.forEach</code>, <code>React.Children.count</code>, <code>React.Children.only</code>, <code>React.Children.toArray</code>.</p>
<p>A simple usage of children prop looks as below,</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
const MyDiv = React.createClass({
  render: function() {</p>
<pre><code>return &lt;div&gt;{this.props.children}&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><p>  }
})</p>
<p>ReactDOM.render(
  <MyDiv></p>
<pre><code>&lt;span&gt;{&#39;Hello&#39;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;{&#39;World&#39;}&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre><p>  &lt;/MyDiv&gt;,
  node
)
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to write comments in React?</h3>
<p>The comments in React/JSX are similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.</p>
<p><strong>Single-line comments:</strong></p>
<p><code>``jsx harmony
&lt;div&gt;
  {/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(//)) */}
  {</code>Welcome ${user}, let&#39;s play React`}
&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<pre><code>
**Multi-line comments:**

```jsx harmony
&lt;div&gt;
  {/* Multi-line comments for more than
   one line */}
  {`Welcome ${user}, let&#39;s play React`}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?</h3>
<p>A child class constructor cannot make use of <code>this</code> reference until <code>super()</code> method has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason of passing props parameter to <code>super()</code> call is to access <code>this.props</code> in your child constructors.</p>
<p><strong>Passing props:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    console.log(this.props) // prints { name: &#39;John&#39;, age: 42 }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Not passing props:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super()

    console.log(this.props) // prints undefined

    // but props parameter is still available
    console.log(props) // prints { name: &#39;John&#39;, age: 42 }
  }

  render() {
    // no difference outside constructor
    console.log(this.props) // prints { name: &#39;John&#39;, age: 42 }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippets reveals that <code>this.props</code> is different only within the constructor. It would be the same outside the constructor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is reconciliation?</h3>
<p>When a component&#39;s props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called <em>reconciliation</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to set state with a dynamic key name?</h3>
<p>If you are using ES6 or the Babel transpiler to transform your JSX code then you can accomplish this with <em>computed property names</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">handleInputChange(event) {
  this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders?</h3>
<p>You need to make sure that function is not being called while passing the function as a parameter.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
render() {
  // Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference!
  return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>{&#39;Click Me&#39;}</button>
}</p>
<pre><code>
Instead, pass the function itself without parenthesis:

```jsx harmony
render() {
  // Correct: handleClick is passed as a reference!
  return &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;{&#39;Click Me&#39;}&lt;/button&gt;
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is lazy function supports named exports?</h3>
No, currently <code>React.lazy</code> function supports default exports only. If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don’t pull unused components.
Let&#39;s take a component file which exports multiple named components,<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// MoreComponents.js
export const SomeComponent = /* ... */;
export const UnusedComponent = /* ... */;
</code></pre>
and reexport <code>MoreComponents.js</code> components in an intermediate file <code>IntermediateComponent.js</code><pre><code class="lang-javascript">// IntermediateComponent.js
export { SomeComponent as default } from &quot;./MoreComponents.js&quot;;
</code></pre>
Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import React, { lazy } from &#39;react&#39;;
const SomeComponent = lazy(() =&gt; import(&quot;./IntermediateComponent.js&quot;));
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why React uses <code>className</code> over <code>class</code> attribute?</h3>
<p><code>class</code> is a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript. That&#39;s the principal reason why React uses <code>className</code> instead of <code>class</code>. Pass a string as the <code>className</code> prop.</p>
<p><code>jsx harmony
render() {
  return &lt;span className={&#39;menu navigation-menu&#39;}&gt;{&#39;Menu&#39;}&lt;/span&gt;
}</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are fragments?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements. <em>Fragments</em> let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
render() {
  return (</p>
<pre><code>&lt;React.Fragment&gt;
  &lt;ChildA /&gt;
  &lt;ChildB /&gt;
  &lt;ChildC /&gt;
&lt;/React.Fragment&gt;
</code></pre><p>  )
}</p>
<pre><code>
There is also a *shorter syntax*, but it&#39;s not supported in many tools:

```jsx harmony
render() {
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;ChildA /&gt;
      &lt;ChildB /&gt;
      &lt;ChildC /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why fragments are better than container divs?</h3>
<p>Below are the list of reasons,</p>
<ol>
<li>Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.</li>
<li>Some CSS mechanisms like <em>Flexbox</em> and <em>CSS Grid</em> have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.</li>
<li>The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are portals in React?</h3>
<p><em>Portal</em> is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)
</code></pre>
<p>The first argument is any render-able React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument is a DOM element.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are stateless components?</h3>
<p>If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the <code>this</code> keyword altogether.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are stateful components?</h3>
<p>If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the <em>state</em> of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These <em>stateful components</em> are always <em>class components</em> and have a state that gets initialized in the <code>constructor</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }

  render() {
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>React 16.8 Update:</strong></p>
<p> Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing classes.</p>
<p> <em>The Equivalent Functional Component</em></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">    import React, {useState} from &#39;react&#39;;

    const App = (props) =&gt; {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      return (
        // JSX
      )
    }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to apply validation on props in React?</h3>
<p>When the application is running in <em>development mode</em>, React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have <em>correct type</em>. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It&#39;s disabled in <em>production mode</em> due to performance impact. The mandatory props are defined with <code>isRequired</code>.</p>
<p>The set of predefined prop types:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>PropTypes.number</code></li>
<li><code>PropTypes.string</code></li>
<li><code>PropTypes.array</code></li>
<li><code>PropTypes.object</code></li>
<li><code>PropTypes.func</code></li>
<li><code>PropTypes.node</code></li>
<li><code>PropTypes.element</code></li>
<li><code>PropTypes.bool</code></li>
<li><code>PropTypes.symbol</code></li>
<li><code>PropTypes.any</code></li>
</ol>
<p>We can define <code>propTypes</code> for <code>User</code> component as below:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import React from &#39;react&#39;
import PropTypes from &#39;prop-types&#39;</p>
<p>class User extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {</p>
<pre><code>name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
age: PropTypes.number.isRequired
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  render() {</p>
<pre><code>return (
  &lt;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{`Welcome, ${this.props.name}`}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;{`Age, ${this.props.age}`}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/&gt;
)
</code></pre><p>  }
}
```</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In React v15.5 <em>PropTypes</em> were moved from <code>React.PropTypes</code> to <code>prop-types</code> library.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the advantages of React?</h3>
<p>Below are the list of main advantages of React,</p>
<ol>
<li>Increases the application&#39;s performance with <em>Virtual DOM</em>.</li>
<li>JSX makes code easy to read and write.</li>
<li>It renders both on client and server side (<em>SSR</em>).</li>
<li>Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone) since it is only a view library.</li>
<li>Easy to write unit and integration tests with tools such as Jest.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the limitations of React?</h3>
<p>Apart from the advantages, there are few limitations of React too,</p>
<ol>
<li>React is just a view library, not a full framework.</li>
<li>There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.</li>
<li>Integrating React into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration.</li>
<li>The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.</li>
<li>Too many smaller components leading to over engineering or boilerplate.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are error boundaries in React v16?</h3>
<p><em>Error boundaries</em> are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.</p>
<p>A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called <code>componentDidCatch(error, info)</code> or <code>static getDerivedStateFromError()</code>:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {</p>
<pre><code>super(props)
this.state = { hasError: false }
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  componentDidCatch(error, info) {</p>
<pre><code>// You can also log the error to an error reporting service
logErrorToMyService(error, info)
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {</p>
<pre><code> // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
 return { hasError: true };
</code></pre><p>   }</p>
<p>  render() {</p>
<pre><code>if (this.state.hasError) {
  // You can render any custom fallback UI
  return &lt;h1&gt;{&#39;Something went wrong.&#39;}&lt;/h1&gt;
}
return this.props.children
</code></pre><p>  }
}</p>
<pre><code>
After that use it as a regular component:

```jsx harmony
&lt;ErrorBoundary&gt;
  &lt;MyWidget /&gt;
&lt;/ErrorBoundary&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How error boundaries handled in React v15?</h3>
<p>React v15 provided very basic support for <em>error boundaries</em> using <code>unstable_handleError</code> method. It has been renamed to <code>componentDidCatch</code> in React v16.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the recommended ways for static type checking?</h3>
<p>Normally we use <em>PropTypes library</em> (<code>React.PropTypes</code> moved to a <code>prop-types</code> package since React v15.5) for <em>type checking</em> in the React applications. For large code bases, it is recommended to use <em>static type checkers</em> such as Flow or TypeScript, that perform type checking at compile time and provide auto-completion features.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the use of <code>react-dom</code> package?</h3>
<p>The <code>react-dom</code> package provides <em>DOM-specific methods</em> that can be used at the top level of your app. Most of the components are not required to use this module. Some of the methods of this package are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>render()</code></li>
<li><code>hydrate()</code></li>
<li><code>unmountComponentAtNode()</code></li>
<li><code>findDOMNode()</code></li>
<li><code>createPortal()</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of render method of <code>react-dom</code>?</h3>
<p>This method is used to render a React element into the DOM in the supplied container and return a reference to the component. If the React element was previously rendered into container, it will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest changes.</p>
<pre><code>ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback])
</code></pre><p>If the optional callback is provided, it will be executed after the component is rendered or updated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is ReactDOMServer?</h3>
<p>The <code>ReactDOMServer</code> object enables you to render components to static markup (typically used on node server). This object is mainly used for <em>server-side rendering</em> (SSR). The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>renderToString()</code></li>
<li><code>renderToStaticMarkup()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, you generally run a Node-based web server like Express, Hapi, or Koa, and you call <code>renderToString</code> to render your root component to a string, which you then send as response.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// using Express
import { renderToString } from &#39;react-dom/server&#39;
import MyPage from &#39;./MyPage&#39;

app.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.write(&#39;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My Page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#39;)
  res.write(&#39;&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&#39;)
  res.write(renderToString(&lt;MyPage/&gt;))
  res.write(&#39;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#39;)
  res.end()
})
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use innerHTML in React?</h3>
<p>The <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code> attribute is React&#39;s replacement for using <code>innerHTML</code> in the browser DOM. Just like <code>innerHTML</code>, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You just need to pass a <code>__html</code> object as key and HTML text as value.</p>
<p>In this example MyComponent uses <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code> attribute for setting HTML markup:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
function createMarkup() {
  return { __html: &#39;First &middot; Second&#39; }
}</p>
<p>function MyComponent() {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()} />
}
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use styles in React?</h3>
<p>The <code>style</code> attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
const divStyle = {
  color: &#39;blue&#39;,
  backgroundImage: &#39;url(&#39; + imgUrl + &#39;)&#39;
};</p>
<p>function HelloWorldComponent() {
  return <div style={divStyle}>Hello World!</div>
}
```</p>
<p>Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes in JavaScript (e.g. <code>node.style.backgroundImage</code>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How events are different in React?</h3>
<p>Handling events in React elements has some syntactic differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>React event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.</li>
<li>With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What will happen if you use <code>setState()</code> in constructor?</h3>
<p>When you use <code>setState()</code>, then apart from assigning to the object state React also re-renders the component and all its children. You would get error like this: <em>Can only update a mounted or mounting component.</em> So we need to use <code>this.state</code> to initialize variables inside constructor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the impact of indexes as keys?</h3>
<p>Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique so that React can keep track of elements.</p>
<p>In the below code snippet each element&#39;s key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented. This limits the optimizations that React can do.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
{todos.map((todo, index) =&gt;
  &lt;Todo</p>
<pre><code>{...todo}
key={index}
</code></pre><p>  /&gt;
)}</p>
<pre><code>
If you use element data for unique key, assuming todo.id is unique to this list and stable, React would be able to reorder elements without needing to reevaluate them as much.

```jsx harmony
{todos.map((todo) =&gt;
  &lt;Todo {...todo}
    key={todo.id} /&gt;
)}
</code></pre></li>

<ol>
<li><h3>Is it good to use <code>setState()</code> in <code>componentWillMount()</code> method?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is safe to use <code>setState()</code> inside <code>componentWillMount()</code> method. But at the same it is recommended to avoid async initialization in <code>componentWillMount()</code> lifecycle method. <code>componentWillMount()</code> is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before <code>render()</code>, therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in <code>componentDidMount()</code> instead of <code>componentWillMount()</code>.</p>
<p><code>``jsx harmony
componentDidMount() {
  axios.get(</code>api/todos`)</p>
<pre><code>.then((result) =&gt; {
  this.setState({
    messages: [...result.data]
  })
})
</code></pre><p>}
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What will happen if you use props in initial state?</h3>
<p>If the props on the component are changed without the component being refreshed, the new prop value will never be displayed because the constructor function will never update the current state of the component. The initialization of state from props only runs when the component is first created.</p>
<p>The below component won&#39;t display the updated input value:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {</p>
<pre><code>super(props)

this.state = {
  records: [],
  inputValue: this.props.inputValue
};
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  render() {</p>
<pre><code>return &lt;div&gt;{this.state.inputValue}&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><p>  }
}</p>
<pre><code>
Using props inside render method will update the value:

```jsx harmony
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      record: []
    }
  }

  render() {
    return &lt;div&gt;{this.props.inputValue}&lt;/div&gt;
  }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you conditionally render components?</h3>
<p>In some cases you want to render different components depending on some state. JSX does not render <code>false</code> or <code>undefined</code>, so you can use conditional <em>short-circuiting</em> to render a given part of your component only if a certain condition is true.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) =&gt; (
  <div></p>
<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;{name}&lt;/h2&gt;
{address &amp;&amp;
  &lt;p&gt;{address}&lt;/p&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>  &lt;/div&gt;
)</p>
<pre><code>
If you need an `if-else` condition then use *ternary operator*.

```jsx harmony
const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) =&gt; (
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;{name}&lt;/h2&gt;
    {address
      ? &lt;p&gt;{address}&lt;/p&gt;
      : &lt;p&gt;{&#39;Address is not available&#39;}&lt;/p&gt;
    }
  &lt;/div&gt;
)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why we need to be careful when spreading props on DOM elements?</h3>
<p>When we <em>spread props</em> we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice. Instead we can use prop destructuring with <code>...rest</code> operator, so it will add only required props.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
const ComponentA = () =&gt;</p>
  <ComponentB isDisplay={true} className={'componentStyle'} />

<p>const ComponentB = ({ isDisplay, ...domProps }) =&gt;
  <div {...domProps}>{'ComponentB'}</div>
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How you use decorators in React?</h3>
<p>You can <em>decorate</em> your <em>class</em> components, which is the same as passing the component into a function. <strong>Decorators</strong> are flexible and readable way of modifying component functionality.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
@setTitle(&#39;Profile&#39;)
class Profile extends React.Component {</p>
<pre><code>//....
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>/<em>
  title is a string that will be set as a document title
  WrappedComponent is what our decorator will receive when
  put directly above a component class as seen in the example above
</em>/
const setTitle = (title) =&gt; (WrappedComponent) =&gt; {
  return class extends React.Component {</p>
<pre><code>componentDidMount() {
  document.title = title
}

render() {
  return &lt;WrappedComponent {...this.props} /&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>  }
}
```</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Decorators are a feature that didn&#39;t make it into ES7, but are currently a <em>stage 2 proposal</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you memoize a component?</h3>
<p>There are memoize libraries available which can be used on function components.</p>
<p>For example <code>moize</code> library can memoize the component in another component.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import moize from &#39;moize&#39;
import Component from &#39;./components/Component&#39; // this module exports a non-memoized component</p>
<p>const MemoizedFoo = moize.react(Component)</p>
<p>const Consumer = () =&gt; {
  <div></p>
<pre><code>{&#39;I will memoize the following entry:&#39;}
&lt;MemoizedFoo/&gt;
</code></pre><p>  &lt;/div&gt;
}</p>
<pre><code>
**Update:** Since React v16.6.0, we have a `React.memo`. It provides a higher order component which memoizes component unless the props change. To use it, simply wrap the component using React.memo before you use it.

```js
  const MemoComponent = React.memo(function MemoComponent(props) {
    /* render using props */
  });
  OR
  export default React.memo(MyFunctionComponent);
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How you implement Server Side Rendering or SSR?</h3>
<p>React is already equipped to handle rendering on Node servers. A special version of the DOM renderer is available, which follows the same pattern as on the client side.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import ReactDOMServer from &#39;react-dom/server&#39;
import App from &#39;./App&#39;</p>
<p>ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />)
```</p>
<p>This method will output the regular HTML as a string, which can be then placed inside a page body as part of the server response. On the client side, React detects the pre-rendered content and seamlessly picks up where it left off.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to enable production mode in React?</h3>
<p>You should use Webpack&#39;s <code>DefinePlugin</code> method to set <code>NODE_ENV</code> to <code>production</code>, by which it strip out things like propType validation and extra warnings. Apart from this, if you minify the code, for example, Uglify&#39;s dead-code elimination to strip out development only code and comments, it will drastically reduce the size of your bundle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is CRA and its benefits?</h3>
<p>The <code>create-react-app</code> CLI tool allows you to quickly create &amp; run React applications with no configuration step.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s create Todo App using <em>CRA</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-console"># Installation
$ npm install -g create-react-app

# Create new project
$ create-react-app todo-app
$ cd todo-app

# Build, test and run
$ npm run build
$ npm run test
$ npm start
</code></pre>
<p>It includes everything we need to build a React app:</p>
<ol>
<li>React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.</li>
<li>Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.</li>
<li>Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.</li>
<li>A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.</li>
<li>A live development server that warns about common mistakes.</li>
<li>A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the lifecycle methods order in mounting?</h3>
<p>The lifecycle methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>constructor()</code></li>
<li><code>static getDerivedStateFromProps()</code></li>
<li><code>render()</code></li>
<li><code>componentDidMount()</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the lifecycle methods going to be deprecated in React v16?</h3>
<p>The following lifecycle methods going to be unsafe coding practices and will be more problematic with async rendering.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>componentWillMount()</code></li>
<li><code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code></li>
<li><code>componentWillUpdate()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Starting with React v16.3 these methods are aliased with <code>UNSAFE_</code> prefix, and the unprefixed version will be removed in React v17.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> lifecycle method?</h3>
<p>The new static <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> lifecycle method is invoked after a component is instantiated as well as before it is re-rendered. It can return an object to update state, or <code>null</code> to indicate that the new props do not require any state updates.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This lifecycle method along with <code>componentDidUpdate()</code> covers all the use cases of <code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</code> lifecycle method?</h3>
<p>The new <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</code> lifecycle method is called right before DOM updates. The return value from this method will be passed as the third parameter to <code>componentDidUpdate()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This lifecycle method along with <code>componentDidUpdate()</code> covers all the use cases of <code>componentWillUpdate()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Do Hooks replace render props and higher order components?</h3>
<p>Both render props and higher-order components render only a single child but in most of the cases Hooks are a simpler way to serve this by reducing nesting in your tree.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the recommended way for naming components?</h3>
<p>It is recommended to name the component by reference instead of using <code>displayName</code>.</p>
<p>Using <code>displayName</code> for naming component:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">export default React.createClass({
  displayName: &#39;TodoApp&#39;,
  // ...
})
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>recommended</strong> approach:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">export default class TodoApp extends React.Component {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the recommended ordering of methods in component class?</h3>
<p><em>Recommended</em> ordering of methods from <em>mounting</em> to <em>render stage</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>static</code> methods</li>
<li><code>constructor()</code></li>
<li><code>getChildContext()</code></li>
<li><code>componentWillMount()</code></li>
<li><code>componentDidMount()</code></li>
<li><code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code></li>
<li><code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code></li>
<li><code>componentWillUpdate()</code></li>
<li><code>componentDidUpdate()</code></li>
<li><code>componentWillUnmount()</code></li>
<li>click handlers or event handlers like <code>onClickSubmit()</code> or <code>onChangeDescription()</code></li>
<li>getter methods for render like <code>getSelectReason()</code> or <code>getFooterContent()</code></li>
<li>optional render methods like <code>renderNavigation()</code> or <code>renderProfilePicture()</code></li>
<li><code>render()</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is a switching component?</h3>
<p>A <em>switching component</em> is a component that renders one of many components. We need to use object to map prop values to components.</p>
<p>For example, a switching component to display different pages based on <code>page</code> prop:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import HomePage from &#39;./HomePage&#39;
import AboutPage from &#39;./AboutPage&#39;
import ServicesPage from &#39;./ServicesPage&#39;
import ContactPage from &#39;./ContactPage&#39;</p>
<p>const PAGES = {
  home: HomePage,
  about: AboutPage,
  services: ServicesPage,
  contact: ContactPage
}</p>
<p>const Page = (props) =&gt; {
  const Handler = PAGES[props.page] || ContactPage</p>
<p>  return <Handler {...props} />
}</p>
<p>// The keys of the PAGES object can be used in the prop types to catch dev-time errors.
Page.propTypes = {
  page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired
}
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why we need to pass a function to setState()?</h3>
<p>The reason behind for this is that <code>setState()</code> is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after <code>setState()</code> is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling <code>setState()</code> since you can&#39;t be sure what that state will be. The solution is to  pass a function to <code>setState()</code>, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of <code>setState()</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// assuming this.state.count === 0
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
// this.state.count === 1, not 3
</code></pre>
<p>If we pass a function to <code>setState()</code>, the count gets incremented correctly.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">this.setState((prevState, props) =&gt; ({
  count: prevState.count + props.increment
}))
// this.state.count === 3 as expected
</code></pre>
<p><strong>(OR)</strong></p>
<h3>Why function is preferred over object for <code>setState()</code>?</h3>
<p> React may batch multiple <code>setState()</code> calls into a single update for performance. Because <code>this.props</code> and <code>this.state</code> may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.</p>
<p> This counter example will fail to update as expected:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> // Wrong
 this.setState({
   counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
 })
</code></pre>
<p> The preferred approach is to call <code>setState()</code> with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> // Correct
 this.setState((prevState, props) =&gt; ({
   counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
 }))
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is strict mode in React?</h3>
<p><code>React.StrictMode</code> is a useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application. Just like <code>&lt;Fragment&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;StrictMode&gt;</code> does not render any extra DOM elements. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. These checks apply for <em>development mode</em> only.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import React from &#39;react&#39;</p>
<p>function ExampleApplication() {
  return (</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;Header /&gt;
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;ComponentOne /&gt;
      &lt;ComponentTwo /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;
  &lt;Footer /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><p>  )
}
```</p>
<p>In the example above, the <em>strict mode</em> checks apply to <code>&lt;ComponentOne&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ComponentTwo&gt;</code> components only.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are React Mixins?</h3>
<p><em>Mixins</em> are a way to totally separate components to have a common functionality. Mixins <strong>should not be used</strong> and can be replaced with <em>higher-order components</em> or <em>decorators</em>.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly used mixins is <code>PureRenderMixin</code>. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const PureRenderMixin = require(&#39;react-addons-pure-render-mixin&#39;)

const Button = React.createClass({
  mixins: [PureRenderMixin],
  // ...
})
</code></pre>
<!-- TODO: mixins are deprecated -->
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why is <code>isMounted()</code> an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?</h3>
<p>The primary use case for <code>isMounted()</code> is to avoid calling <code>setState()</code> after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">if (this.isMounted()) {
  this.setState({...})
}
</code></pre>
<p>Checking <code>isMounted()</code> before calling <code>setState()</code> does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using <code>isMounted()</code> is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.</p>
<p>An optimal solution would be to find places where <code>setState()</code> might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in <code>componentWillUnmount()</code>, prior to unmounting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the Pointer Events supported in React?</h3>
<p><em>Pointer Events</em> provide a unified way of handling all input events. In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don&#39;t correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. We need to remember that these events will only work in browsers that support the <em>Pointer Events</em> specification.</p>
<p>The following event types are now available in <em>React DOM</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>onPointerDown</code></li>
<li><code>onPointerMove</code></li>
<li><code>onPointerUp</code></li>
<li><code>onPointerCancel</code></li>
<li><code>onGotPointerCapture</code></li>
<li><code>onLostPointerCapture</code></li>
<li><code>onPointerEnter</code></li>
<li><code>onPointerLeave</code></li>
<li><code>onPointerOver</code></li>
<li><code>onPointerOut</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why should component names start with capital letter?</h3>
<p>If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.
```jsx harmony
class SomeComponent extends Component {
 // Code goes here
}</p>
<pre><code>You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it&#39;s imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:

```jsx harmony
class myComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return &lt;div /&gt;
  }
}

export default myComponent
</code></pre><p>While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:</p>
<p><code>jsx harmony
import MyComponent from &#39;./MyComponent&#39;</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>What are the exceptions on React component naming?</h4>
<pre><code> The component names should start with a uppercase letter but there are few exceptions on this convention. The lowercase tag names with a dot (property accessors) are still considered as valid component names.

 For example the below tag can be compiled to a valid component,
 ```javascript
 render(){
    return (
        &lt;obj.component /&gt; // `React.createElement(obj.component)`
       )
 }
 ```
</code></pre><ol>
<li><h3>Are custom DOM attributes supported in React v16?</h3>
<p>Yes. In the past, React used to ignore unknown DOM attributes. If you wrote JSX with an attribute that React doesn&#39;t recognize, React would just skip it.</p>
<p>For example, let&#39;s take a look at the below attribute:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
<div mycustomattribute={'something'} /></p>
<pre><code>
Would render an empty div to the DOM with React v15:

```html
&lt;div /&gt;
</code></pre><p>In React v16 any unknown attributes will end up in the DOM:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div mycustomattribute=&#39;something&#39; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is useful for supplying browser-specific non-standard attributes, trying new DOM APIs, and integrating with opinionated third-party libraries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between constructor and getInitialState?</h3>
<p>You should initialize state in the constructor when using ES6 classes, and <code>getInitialState()</code> method when using <code>React.createClass()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Using ES6 classes:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { /* initial state */ }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Using <code>React.createClass()</code>:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const MyComponent = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { /* initial state */ }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>React.createClass()</code> is deprecated and removed in React v16. Use plain JavaScript classes instead.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can you force a component to re-render without calling setState?</h3>
<p>By default, when your component&#39;s state or props change, your component will re-render. If your <code>render()</code> method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling <code>forceUpdate()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">component.forceUpdate(callback)
</code></pre>
<p>It is recommended to avoid all uses of <code>forceUpdate()</code> and only read from <code>this.props</code> and <code>this.state</code> in <code>render()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between <code>super()</code> and <code>super(props)</code> in React using ES6 classes?</h3>
<p>When you want to access <code>this.props</code> in <code>constructor()</code> then you should pass props to <code>super()</code> method.</p>
<p><strong>Using <code>super(props)</code>:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    console.log(this.props) // { name: &#39;John&#39;, ... }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Using <code>super()</code>:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super()
    console.log(this.props) // undefined
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Outside <code>constructor()</code> both will display same value for <code>this.props</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to loop inside JSX?</h3>
<p>You can simply use <code>Array.prototype.map</code> with ES6 <em>arrow function</em> syntax.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>items</code> array of objects is mapped into an array of components:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
<tbody>
  {items.map(item => <SomeComponent key={item.id} name={item.name} />)}
</tbody></p>
<pre><code>
But you can&#39;t iterate using `for` loop:

```jsx harmony
&lt;tbody&gt;
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++) {
    &lt;SomeComponent key={items[i].id} name={items[i].name} /&gt;
  }
&lt;/tbody&gt;
</code></pre><p>This is because JSX tags are transpiled into <em>function calls</em>, and you can&#39;t use statements inside expressions. This may change thanks to <code>do</code> expressions which are <em>stage 1 proposal</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you access props in attribute quotes?</h3>
<p>React (or JSX) doesn&#39;t support variable interpolation inside an attribute value. The below representation won&#39;t work:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
<img className='image' src='images/{this.props.image}' /></p>
<pre><code>
But you can put any JS expression inside curly braces as the entire attribute value. So the below expression works:

```jsx harmony
&lt;img className=&#39;image&#39; src={&#39;images/&#39; + this.props.image} /&gt;
</code></pre><p>Using <em>template strings</em> will also work:</p>
<p><code>jsx harmony
&lt;img className=&#39;image&#39; src={`images/${this.props.image}`} /&gt;</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is React proptype array with shape?</h3>
<p>If you want to pass an array of objects to a component with a particular shape then use <code>React.PropTypes.shape()</code> as an argument to <code>React.PropTypes.arrayOf()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">ReactComponent.propTypes = {
  arrayWithShape: React.PropTypes.arrayOf(React.PropTypes.shape({
    color: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    fontSize: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired
  })).isRequired
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to conditionally apply class attributes?</h3>
<p>You shouldn&#39;t use curly braces inside quotes because it is going to be evaluated as a string.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
<div className="btn-panel {this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}"></p>
<pre><code>
Instead you need to move curly braces outside (don&#39;t forget to include spaces between class names):

```jsx harmony
&lt;div className={&#39;btn-panel &#39; + (this.props.visible ? &#39;show&#39; : &#39;hidden&#39;)}&gt;
</code></pre><p><em>Template strings</em> will also work:</p>
<p><code>jsx harmony
&lt;div className={`btn-panel ${this.props.visible ? &#39;show&#39; : &#39;hidden&#39;}`}&gt;</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?</h3>
<p>The <code>react</code> package contains <code>React.createElement()</code>, <code>React.Component</code>, <code>React.Children</code>, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The <code>react-dom</code> package contains <code>ReactDOM.render()</code>, and in <code>react-dom/server</code> we have <em>server-side rendering</em> support with <code>ReactDOMServer.renderToString()</code> and <code>ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why ReactDOM is separated from React?</h3>
<p>The React team worked on extracting all DOM-related features into a separate library called <em>ReactDOM</em>. React v0.14 is the first release in which the libraries are split. By looking at some of the packages, <code>react-native</code>, <code>react-art</code>, <code>react-canvas</code>, and <code>react-three</code>, it has become clear that the beauty and essence of React has nothing to do with browsers or the DOM.</p>
<p>To build more environments that React can render to, React team planned to split the main React package into two: <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code>. This paves the way to writing components that can be shared between the web version of React and React Native.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use React label element?</h3>
<p>If you try to render a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element bound to a text input using the standard <code>for</code> attribute, then it produces HTML missing that attribute and prints a warning to the console.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
<label for={'user'}>{&#39;User&#39;}</label>
<input type={'text'} id={'user'} /></p>
<pre><code>
Since `for` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, use `htmlFor` instead.

```jsx harmony
&lt;label htmlFor={&#39;user&#39;}&gt;{&#39;User&#39;}&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type={&#39;text&#39;} id={&#39;user&#39;} /&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to combine multiple inline style objects?</h3>
<p>You can use <em>spread operator</em> in regular React:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>If you&#39;re using React Native then you can use the array notation:

```jsx harmony
&lt;button style={[styles.panel.button, styles.panel.submitButton]}&gt;{&#39;Submit&#39;}&lt;/button&gt;
```
</code></pre><ol>
<li><h3>How to re-render the view when the browser is resized?</h3>
<p>You can listen to the <code>resize</code> event in <code>componentDidMount()</code> and then update the dimensions (<code>width</code> and <code>height</code>). You should remove the listener in <code>componentWillUnmount()</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class WindowDimensions extends React.Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.updateDimensions = this.updateDimensions.bind(this);
  }

  componentWillMount() {
    this.updateDimensions()
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    window.addEventListener(&#39;resize&#39;, this.updateDimensions)
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    window.removeEventListener(&#39;resize&#39;, this.updateDimensions)
  }

  updateDimensions() {
    this.setState({width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight})
  }

  render() {
    return &lt;span&gt;{this.state.width} x {this.state.height}&lt;/span&gt;
  }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between <code>setState()</code> and <code>replaceState()</code> methods?</h3>
<p>When you use <code>setState()</code> the current and previous states are merged. <code>replaceState()</code> throws out the current state, and replaces it with only what you provide. Usually <code>setState()</code> is used unless you really need to remove all previous keys for some reason. You can also set state to <code>false</code>/<code>null</code> in <code>setState()</code> instead of using <code>replaceState()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to listen to state changes?</h3>
<p>The <code>componentDidUpdate</code> lifecycle method will be called when state changes. You can compare provided state and props values with current state and props to determine if something meaningful changed.</p>
<pre><code>componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState)
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> The previous releases of ReactJS also uses <code>componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)</code> for state changes. It has been deprecated in latest releases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the recommended approach of removing an array element in React state?</h3>
<p>The better approach is to use <code>Array.prototype.filter()</code> method.</p>
<p>For example, let&#39;s create a <code>removeItem()</code> method for updating the state.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">removeItem(index) {
  this.setState({
    data: this.state.data.filter((item, i) =&gt; i !== index)
  })
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is it possible to use React without rendering HTML?</h3>
<p>It is possible with latest version (&gt;=16.2). Below are the possible options:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
render() {
  return false
}</p>
<pre><code>
```jsx harmony
render() {
  return null
}
</code></pre><p>```jsx harmony
render() {
  return []
}</p>
<pre><code>
```jsx harmony
render() {
  return &lt;React.Fragment&gt;&lt;/React.Fragment&gt;
}
</code></pre><p><code>jsx harmony
render() {
  return &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;
}</code></p>
<p>Returning <code>undefined</code> won&#39;t work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to pretty print JSON with React?</h3>
<p>We can use <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag so that the formatting of the <code>JSON.stringify()</code> is retained:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
const data = { name: &#39;John&#39;, age: 42 }</p>
<p>class User extends React.Component {
  render() {</p>
<pre><code>return (
  &lt;pre&gt;
    {JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
  &lt;/pre&gt;
)
</code></pre><p>  }
}</p>
<p>React.render(<User />, document.getElementById(&#39;container&#39;))
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why you can&#39;t update props in React?</h3>
<p>The React philosophy is that props should be <em>immutable</em> and <em>top-down</em>. This means that a parent can send any prop values to a child, but the child can&#39;t modify received props.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to focus an input element on page load?</h3>
<p>You can do it by creating <em>ref</em> for <code>input</code> element and using it in <code>componentDidMount()</code>:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
class App extends React.Component{
  componentDidMount() {</p>
<pre><code>this.nameInput.focus()
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  render() {</p>
<pre><code>return (
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;input
      defaultValue={&#39;Won\&#39;t focus&#39;}
    /&gt;
    &lt;input
      ref={(input) =&gt; this.nameInput = input}
      defaultValue={&#39;Will focus&#39;}
    /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
)
</code></pre><p>  }
}</p>
<p>ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(&#39;app&#39;))
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the possible ways of updating objects in state?</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Calling <code>setState()</code> with an object to merge with state:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using <code>Object.assign()</code> to create a copy of the object:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">  const user = Object.assign({}, this.state.user, { age: 42 })
  this.setState({ user })
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Using <em>spread operator</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">  const user = { ...this.state.user, age: 42 }
  this.setState({ user })
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Calling <code>setState()</code> with a function:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> this.setState(prevState =&gt; ({
   user: {
     ...prevState.user,
     age: 42
   }
 }))
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How can we find the version of React at runtime in the browser?</h3>
<p>You can use <code>React.version</code> to get the version.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
const REACT_VERSION = React.version</p>
<p>ReactDOM.render(
  <div>{`React version: ${REACT_VERSION}`}</div>,
  document.getElementById(&#39;app&#39;)
)
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the approaches to include polyfills in your <code>create-react-app</code>?</h3>
<p>There are approaches to include polyfills in create-react-app,</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Manual import from <code>core-js</code>:</strong></p>
<p> Create a file called (something like) <code>polyfills.js</code> and import it into root <code>index.js</code> file. Run <code>npm install core-js</code> or <code>yarn add core-js</code> and import your specific required features.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> import &#39;core-js/fn/array/find&#39;
 import &#39;core-js/fn/array/includes&#39;
 import &#39;core-js/fn/number/is-nan&#39;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using Polyfill service:</strong></p>
<p> Use the polyfill.io CDN to retrieve custom, browser-specific polyfills by adding this line to <code>index.html</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"> &lt;script src=&#39;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=default,Array.prototype.includes&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p> In the above script we had to explicitly request the <code>Array.prototype.includes</code> feature as it is not included in the default feature set.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use https instead of http in create-react-app?</h3>
<p>You just need to use <code>HTTPS=true</code> configuration. You can edit your <code>package.json</code> scripts section:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">&quot;scripts&quot;: {
  &quot;start&quot;: &quot;set HTTPS=true &amp;&amp; react-scripts start&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>or just run <code>set HTTPS=true &amp;&amp; npm start</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to avoid using relative path imports in create-react-app?</h3>
<p>Create a file called <code>.env</code> in the project root and write the import path:</p>
<pre><code>NODE_PATH=src/app
</code></pre><p>After that restart the development server. Now you should be able to import anything inside <code>src/app</code> without relative paths.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to add Google Analytics for React Router?</h3>
<p>Add a listener on the <code>history</code> object to record each page view:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">history.listen(function (location) {
  window.ga(&#39;set&#39;, &#39;page&#39;, location.pathname + location.search)
  window.ga(&#39;send&#39;, &#39;pageview&#39;, location.pathname + location.search)
})
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to update a component every second?</h3>
<p>You need to use <code>setInterval()</code> to trigger the change, but you also need to clear the timer when the component unmounts to prevent errors and memory leaks.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">componentDidMount() {
  this.interval = setInterval(() =&gt; this.setState({ time: Date.now() }), 1000)
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  clearInterval(this.interval)
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you apply vendor prefixes to inline styles in React?</h3>
<p>React <em>does not</em> apply <em>vendor prefixes</em> automatically. You need to add vendor prefixes manually.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to import and export components using React and ES6?</h3>
<p>You should use default for exporting the components</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import React from &#39;react&#39;
import User from &#39;user&#39;</p>
<p>export default class MyProfile extends React.Component {
  render(){</p>
<pre><code>return (
  &lt;User type=&quot;customer&quot;&gt;
    //...
  &lt;/User&gt;
)
</code></pre><p>  }
}
```</p>
<p>With the export specifier, the MyProfile is going to be the member and exported to this module and the same can be imported without mentioning the name in other components.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why is a component constructor called only once?</h3>
<p>React&#39;s <em>reconciliation</em> algorithm assumes that without any information to the contrary, if a custom component appears in the same place on subsequent renders, it&#39;s the same component as before, so reuses the previous instance rather than creating a new one.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to define constants in React?</h3>
<p>You can use ES7 <code>static</code> field to define constant.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  static DEFAULT_PAGINATION = 10
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Static fields</em> are part of the <em>Class Fields</em> stage 3 proposal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to programmatically trigger click event in React?</h3>
<p>You could use the ref prop to acquire a reference to the underlying <code>HTMLInputElement</code> object through a callback, store the reference as a class property, then use that reference to later trigger a click from your event handlers using the <code>HTMLElement.click</code> method.</p>
<p>This can be done in two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create ref in render method:</p>
<p> <code>jsx harmony
 &lt;input ref={input =&gt; this.inputElement = input} /&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Apply click event in your event handler:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> this.inputElement.click()
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is it possible to use async/await in plain React?</h3>
<p>If you want to use <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> in React, you will need <em>Babel</em> and <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator">transform-async-to-generator</a> plugin. React Native ships with Babel and a set of transforms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the common folder structures for React?</h3>
<p>There are two common practices for React project file structure.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Grouping by features or routes:</strong></p>
<p> One common way to structure projects is locate CSS, JS, and tests together, grouped by feature or route.</p>
<pre><code> common/
 ├─ Avatar.js
 ├─ Avatar.css
 ├─ APIUtils.js
 └─ APIUtils.test.js
 feed/
 ├─ index.js
 ├─ Feed.js
 ├─ Feed.css
 ├─ FeedStory.js
 ├─ FeedStory.test.js
 └─ FeedAPI.js
 profile/
 ├─ index.js
 ├─ Profile.js
 ├─ ProfileHeader.js
 ├─ ProfileHeader.css
 └─ ProfileAPI.js
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Grouping by file type:</strong></p>
<p> Another popular way to structure projects is to group similar files together.</p>
<pre><code> api/
 ├─ APIUtils.js
 ├─ APIUtils.test.js
 ├─ ProfileAPI.js
 └─ UserAPI.js
 components/
 ├─ Avatar.js
 ├─ Avatar.css
 ├─ Feed.js
 ├─ Feed.css
 ├─ FeedStory.js
 ├─ FeedStory.test.js
 ├─ Profile.js
 ├─ ProfileHeader.js
 └─ ProfileHeader.css
</code></pre></li>

<li><h3>What are the popular packages for animation?</h3>
<p><em>React Transition Group</em> and <em>React Motion</em> are popular animation packages in React ecosystem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the benefit of styles modules?</h3>
<p>It is recommended to avoid hard coding style values in components. Any values that are likely to be used across different UI components should be extracted into their own modules.</p>
<p>For example, these styles could be extracted into a separate component:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">export const colors = {
  white,
  black,
  blue
}

export const space = [
  0,
  8,
  16,
  32,
  64
]
</code></pre>
<p>And then imported individually in other components:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import { space, colors } from &#39;./styles&#39;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the popular React-specific linters?</h3>
<p>ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter. There are plugins available that analyse specific code styles. One of the most common for React is an npm package called <code>eslint-plugin-react</code>. By default, it will check a number of best practices, with rules checking things from keys in iterators to a complete set of prop types.</p>
<p>Another popular plugin is <code>eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</code>, which will help fix common issues with accessibility. As JSX offers slightly different syntax to regular HTML, issues with <code>alt</code> text and <code>tabindex</code>, for example, will not be picked up by regular plugins.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to make AJAX call and in which component lifecycle methods should I make an AJAX call?</h3>
<p>You can use AJAX libraries such as Axios, jQuery AJAX, and the browser built-in <code>fetch</code>. You should fetch data in the <code>componentDidMount()</code> lifecycle method. This is so you can use <code>setState()</code> to update your component when the data is retrieved.</p>
<p>For example, the employees list fetched from API and set local state:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {</p>
<pre><code>super(props)
this.state = {
  employees: [],
  error: null
}
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  componentDidMount() {</p>
<pre><code>fetch(&#39;https://api.example.com/items&#39;)
  .then(res =&gt; res.json())
  .then(
    (result) =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        employees: result.employees
      })
    },
    (error) =&gt; {
      this.setState({ error })
    }
  )
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
<p>  render() {</p>
<pre><code>const { error, employees } = this.state
if (error) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Error: {error.message}&lt;/div&gt;;
} else {
  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {employees.map(employee =&gt; (
        &lt;li key={employee.name}&gt;
          {employee.name}-{employee.experience}
        &lt;/li&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre><p>  }
}
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are render props?</h3>
<p><strong>Render Props</strong> is a simple technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. The below component uses render prop which returns a React element.</p>
<p><code>jsx harmony
&lt;DataProvider render={data =&gt; (
  &lt;h1&gt;{`Hello ${data.target}`}&lt;/h1&gt;
)}/&gt;</code></p>
<p>Libraries such as React Router and DownShift are using this pattern.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>React Router</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is React Router?</h3>
<p>React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React that helps you add new screens and flows to your application incredibly quickly, all while keeping the URL in sync with what&#39;s being displayed on the page.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How React Router is different from history library?</h3>
<p>React Router is a wrapper around the <code>history</code> library which handles interaction with the browser&#39;s <code>window.history</code> with its browser and hash histories. It also provides memory history which is useful for environments that don&#39;t have global history, such as mobile app development (React Native) and unit testing with Node.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code> components of React Router v4?</h3>
<p>React Router v4 provides below 3 <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code> components:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;MemoryRouter&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The above components will create <em>browser</em>, <em>hash</em>, and <em>memory</em> history instances. React Router v4 makes the properties and methods of the <code>history</code> instance associated with your router available through the context in the <code>router</code> object.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of <code>push()</code> and <code>replace()</code> methods of <code>history</code>?</h3>
<p>A history instance has two methods for navigation purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>push()</code></li>
<li><code>replace()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If you think of the history as an array of visited locations, <code>push()</code> will add a new location to the array and <code>replace()</code> will replace the current location in the array with the new one.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you programmatically navigate using React Router v4?</h3>
<p>There are three different ways to achieve programmatic routing/navigation within components.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Using the <code>withRouter()</code> higher-order function:</strong></p>
<p> The <code>withRouter()</code> higher-order function will inject the history object as a prop of the component. This object provides <code>push()</code> and <code>replace()</code> methods to avoid the usage of context.</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 import { withRouter } from &#39;react-router-dom&#39; // this also works with &#39;react-router-native&#39;</p>
<p> const Button = withRouter(({ history }) =&gt; (
   &lt;button</p>
<pre><code> type=&#39;button&#39;
 onClick={() =&gt; { history.push(&#39;/new-location&#39;) }}
</code></pre><p>   &gt;</p>
<pre><code> {&#39;Click Me!&#39;}
</code></pre><p>   &lt;/button&gt;
 ))
 ```</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> component and render props pattern:</strong></p>
<p> The <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> component passes the same props as <code>withRouter()</code>, so you will be able to access the history methods through the history prop.</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 import { Route } from &#39;react-router-dom&#39;</p>
<p> const Button = () =&gt; (
   <Route render={({ history }) => (</p>
<pre><code> &lt;button
   type=&#39;button&#39;
   onClick={() =&gt; { history.push(&#39;/new-location&#39;) }}
 &gt;
   {&#39;Click Me!&#39;}
 &lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre><p>   )} /&gt;
 )
 ```</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using context:</strong></p>
<p> This option is not recommended and treated as unstable API.</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 const Button = (props, context) =&gt; (
   &lt;button</p>
<pre><code> type=&#39;button&#39;
 onClick={() =&gt; {
   context.history.push(&#39;/new-location&#39;)
 }}
</code></pre><p>   &gt;</p>
<pre><code> {&#39;Click Me!&#39;}
</code></pre><p>   &lt;/button&gt;
 )</p>
<p> Button.contextTypes = {
   history: React.PropTypes.shape({</p>
<pre><code> push: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired
</code></pre><p>   })
 }
 ```</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to get query parameters in React Router v4?</h3>
<p>The ability to parse query strings was taken out of React Router v4 because there have been user requests over the years to support different implementation. So the decision has been given to users to choose the implementation they like. The recommended approach is to use query strings library.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const queryString = require(&#39;query-string&#39;);
const parsed = queryString.parse(props.location.search);
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>URLSearchParams</code> if you want something native:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const params = new URLSearchParams(props.location.search)
const foo = params.get(&#39;name&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>You should use a <em>polyfill</em> for IE11.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why you get &quot;Router may have only one child element&quot; warning?</h3>
<p>You have to wrap your Route&#39;s in a <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> block because <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> is unique in that it renders a route exclusively.</p>
<p>At first you need to add <code>Switch</code> to your imports:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import { Switch, Router, Route } from &#39;react-router&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>Then define the routes within <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> block:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
<Router>
  <Switch></p>
<pre><code>&lt;Route {/* ... */} /&gt;
&lt;Route {/* ... */} /&gt;
</code></pre><p>  &lt;/Switch&gt;
&lt;/Router&gt;
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to pass params to <code>history.push</code> method in React Router v4?</h3>
<p>While navigating you can pass props to the <code>history</code> object:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">this.props.history.push({
  pathname: &#39;/template&#39;,
  search: &#39;?name=sudheer&#39;,
  state: { detail: response.data }
})
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>search</code> property is used to pass query params in <code>push()</code> method.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>How to implement <em>default</em> or <em>NotFound</em> page?</h3>
<p>A <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> renders the first child <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> that matches. A <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> with no path always matches. So you just need to simply drop path attribute as below</p>
<p><code>jsx harmony
&lt;Switch&gt;
  &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/&quot; component={Home}/&gt;
  &lt;Route path=&quot;/user&quot; component={User}/&gt;
  &lt;Route component={NotFound} /&gt;
&lt;/Switch&gt;</code></p>

<li><h3>How to get history on React Router v4?</h3>
<p>Below are the list of steps to get history object on React Router v4,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a module that exports a <code>history</code> object and import this module across the project.</p>
<p> For example, create <code>history.js</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> import { createBrowserHistory } from &#39;history&#39;

 export default createBrowserHistory({
   /* pass a configuration object here if needed */
 })
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>You should use the <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code> component instead of built-in routers. Imported the above <code>history.js</code> inside <code>index.js</code> file:</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 import { Router } from &#39;react-router-dom&#39;
 import history from &#39;./history&#39;
 import App from &#39;./App&#39;</p>
<p> ReactDOM.render((
   <Router history={history}></p>
<pre><code> &lt;App /&gt;
</code></pre><p>   &lt;/Router&gt;
 ), holder)
 ```</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also use push method of <code>history</code> object similar to built-in history object:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> // some-other-file.js
 import history from &#39;./history&#39;

 history.push(&#39;/go-here&#39;)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to perform automatic redirect after login?</h3>
<p>The <code>react-router</code> package provides <code>&lt;Redirect&gt;</code> component in React Router. Rendering a <code>&lt;Redirect&gt;</code> will navigate to a new location. Like server-side redirects, the new location will override the current location in the history stack.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;
import { Redirect } from &#39;react-router&#39;

export default class LoginComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    if (this.state.isLoggedIn === true) {
      return &lt;Redirect to=&quot;/your/redirect/page&quot; /&gt;
    } else {
      return &lt;div&gt;{&#39;Login Please&#39;}&lt;/div&gt;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>React Internationalization</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is React Intl?</h3>
<p>The <em>React Intl</em> library makes internalization in React straightforward, with off-the-shelf components and an API that can handle everything from formatting strings, dates, and numbers, to pluralization. React Intl is part of <em>FormatJS</em> which provides bindings to React via its components and API.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the main features of React Intl?</h3>
<p>Below are the main features of React Intl,</p>
<ol>
<li>Display numbers with separators.</li>
<li>Display dates and times correctly.</li>
<li>Display dates relative to &quot;now&quot;.</li>
<li>Pluralize labels in strings.</li>
<li>Support for 150+ languages.</li>
<li>Runs in the browser and Node.</li>
<li>Built on standards.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the two ways of formatting in React Intl?</h3>
<p>The library provides two ways to format strings, numbers, and dates:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Using react components:</strong></p>
<p> <code>jsx harmony
 &lt;FormattedMessage
   id={&#39;account&#39;}
   defaultMessage={&#39;The amount is less than minimum balance.&#39;}
 /&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using an API:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> const messages = defineMessages({
   accountMessage: {
     id: &#39;account&#39;,
     defaultMessage: &#39;The amount is less than minimum balance.&#39;,
   }
 })

 formatMessage(messages.accountMessage)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use <code>&lt;FormattedMessage&gt;</code> as placeholder using React Intl?</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;Formatted... /&gt;</code> components from <code>react-intl</code> return elements, not plain text, so they can&#39;t be used for placeholders, alt text, etc. In that case, you should use lower level API <code>formatMessage()</code>. You can inject the <code>intl</code> object into your component using <code>injectIntl()</code> higher-order component and then format the message using <code>formatMessage()</code> available on that object.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import React from &#39;react&#39;
import { injectIntl, intlShape } from &#39;react-intl&#39;</p>
<p>const MyComponent = ({ intl }) =&gt; {
  const placeholder = intl.formatMessage({id: &#39;messageId&#39;})
  return <input placeholder={placeholder} />
}</p>
<p>MyComponent.propTypes = {
  intl: intlShape.isRequired
}</p>
<p>export default injectIntl(MyComponent)
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to access current locale with React Intl?</h3>
<p>You can get the current locale in any component of your application using <code>injectIntl()</code>:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import { injectIntl, intlShape } from &#39;react-intl&#39;</p>
<p>const MyComponent = ({ intl }) =&gt; (
  <div>{`The current locale is ${intl.locale}`}</div>
)</p>
<p>MyComponent.propTypes = {
  intl: intlShape.isRequired
}</p>
<p>export default injectIntl(MyComponent)
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to format date using React Intl?</h3>
<p>The <code>injectIntl()</code> higher-order component will give you access to the <code>formatDate()</code> method via the props in your component. The method is used internally by instances of <code>FormattedDate</code> and it returns the string representation of the formatted date.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import { injectIntl, intlShape } from &#39;react-intl&#39;</p>
<p>const stringDate = this.props.intl.formatDate(date, {
  year: &#39;numeric&#39;,
  month: &#39;numeric&#39;,
  day: &#39;numeric&#39;
})</p>
<p>const MyComponent = ({intl}) =&gt; (
  <div>{`The formatted date is ${stringDate}`}</div>
)</p>
<p>MyComponent.propTypes = {
  intl: intlShape.isRequired
}</p>
<p>export default injectIntl(MyComponent)
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>React Testing</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Shallow Renderer in React testing?</h3>
<p><em>Shallow rendering</em> is useful for writing unit test cases in React. It lets you render a component <em>one level deep</em> and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered.</p>
<p>For example, if you have the following component:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function MyComponent() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;span className={&#39;heading&#39;}&gt;{&#39;Title&#39;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span className={&#39;description&#39;}&gt;{&#39;Description&#39;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can assert as follows:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import ShallowRenderer from &#39;react-test-renderer/shallow&#39;</p>
<p>// in your test
const renderer = new ShallowRenderer()
renderer.render(<MyComponent />)</p>
<p>const result = renderer.getRenderOutput()</p>
<p>expect(result.type).toBe(&#39;div&#39;)
expect(result.props.children).toEqual([
  <span className={'heading'}>{&#39;Title&#39;}</span>,
  <span className={'description'}>{&#39;Description&#39;}</span>
])
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is <code>TestRenderer</code> package in React?</h3>
<p>This package provides a renderer that can be used to render components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment. This package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the platform view hierarchy (similar to a DOM tree) rendered by a ReactDOM or React Native without using a browser or <code>jsdom</code>.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import TestRenderer from &#39;react-test-renderer&#39;</p>
<p>const Link = ({page, children}) =&gt; <a href={page}>{children}</a></p>
<p>const testRenderer = TestRenderer.create(
  <Link page={'https://www.facebook.com/'}>{'Facebook'}</Link>
)</p>
<p>console.log(testRenderer.toJSON())
// {
//   type: &#39;a&#39;,
//   props: { href: &#39;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</a>&#39; },
//   children: [ &#39;Facebook&#39; ]
// }
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of ReactTestUtils package?</h3>
<p><em>ReactTestUtils</em> are provided in the <code>with-addons</code> package and allow you to perform actions against a simulated DOM for the purpose of unit testing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Jest?</h3>
<p><em>Jest</em> is a JavaScript unit testing framework created by Facebook based on Jasmine and provides automated mock creation and a <code>jsdom</code> environment. It&#39;s often used for testing components.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the advantages of Jest over Jasmine?</h3>
<p>There are couple of advantages compared to Jasmine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically finds tests to execute in your source code.</li>
<li>Automatically mocks dependencies when running your tests.</li>
<li>Allows you to test asynchronous code synchronously.</li>
<li>Runs your tests with a fake DOM implementation (via <code>jsdom</code>) so that your tests can be run on the command line.</li>
<li>Runs tests in parallel processes so that they finish sooner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Give a simple example of Jest test case</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s write a test for a function that adds two numbers in <code>sum.js</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const sum = (a, b) =&gt; a + b

export default sum
</code></pre>
<p>Create a file named <code>sum.test.js</code> which contains actual test:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import sum from &#39;./sum&#39;

test(&#39;adds 1 + 2 to equal 3&#39;, () =&gt; {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})
</code></pre>
<p>And then add the following section to your <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;jest&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, run <code>yarn test</code> or <code>npm test</code> and Jest will print a result:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-console">$ yarn test
PASS ./sum.test.js
✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (2ms)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>React Redux</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is flux?</h3>
<p><em>Flux</em> is an <em>application design paradigm</em> used as a replacement for the more traditional MVC pattern. It is not a framework or a library but a new kind of architecture that complements React and the concept of Unidirectional Data Flow. Facebook uses this pattern internally when working with React.</p>
<p>The workflow between dispatcher, stores and views components with distinct inputs and outputs as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/flux.png" alt="flux"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Redux?</h3>
<p><em>Redux</em> is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps based on the <em>Flux design pattern</em>. Redux can be used together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (about 2kB) and has no dependencies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the core principles of Redux?</h3>
<p>Redux follows three fundamental principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Single source of truth:</strong> The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.</li>
<li><strong>State is read-only:</strong> The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.</li>
<li><strong>Changes are made with pure functions:</strong> To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?</h3>
<p>Instead of saying downsides we can say that there are few compromises of using Redux over Flux. Those are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You will need to learn to avoid mutations:</strong> Flux is un-opinionated about mutating data, but Redux doesn&#39;t like mutations and many packages complementary to Redux assume you never mutate the state. You can enforce this with dev-only packages like <code>redux-immutable-state-invariant</code>, Immutable.js, or instructing your team to write non-mutating code.</li>
<li><strong>You&#39;re going to have to carefully pick your packages:</strong> While Flux explicitly doesn&#39;t try to solve problems such as undo/redo, persistence, or forms, Redux has extension points such as middleware and store enhancers, and it has spawned a rich ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>There is no nice Flow integration yet:</strong> Flux currently lets you do very impressive static type checks which Redux doesn&#39;t support yet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between <code>mapStateToProps()</code> and <code>mapDispatchToProps()</code>?</h3>
<p><code>mapStateToProps()</code> is a utility which helps your component get updated state (which is updated by some other components):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const mapStateToProps = (state) =&gt; {
  return {
    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>mapDispatchToProps()</code> is a utility which will help your component to fire an action event (dispatching action which may cause change of application state):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) =&gt; {
  return {
    onTodoClick: (id) =&gt; {
      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Recommend always using the “object shorthand” form for the <code>mapDispatchToProps</code></p>
<p>Redux wrap it in another function that looks like (…args) =&gt; dispatch(onTodoClick(…args)), and pass that wrapper function as a prop to your component.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">  const mapDispatchToProps = ({
    onTodoClick
  })
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can I dispatch an action in reducer?</h3>
<p>Dispatching an action within a reducer is an <strong>anti-pattern</strong>. Your reducer should be <em>without side effects</em>, simply digesting the action payload and returning a new state object. Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead to chained actions and other side effects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to access Redux store outside a component?</h3>
<p>You just need to export the store from the module where it created with <code>createStore()</code>. Also, it shouldn&#39;t pollute the global window object.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">store = createStore(myReducer)

export default store
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the drawbacks of MVW pattern?</h3>
<ol>
<li>DOM manipulation is very expensive which causes applications to behave slow and inefficient.</li>
<li>Due to circular dependencies, a complicated model was created around models and views.</li>
<li>Lot of data changes happens for collaborative applications(like Google Docs).</li>
<li>No way to do undo (travel back in time) easily without adding so much extra code.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Are there any similarities between Redux and RxJS?</h3>
<p>These libraries are very different for very different purposes, but there are some vague similarities.</p>
<p>Redux is a tool for managing state throughout the application. It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to dispatch an action on load?</h3>
<p>You can dispatch an action in <code>componentDidMount()</code> method and in <code>render()</code> method you can verify the data.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.props.fetchData()
  }

  render() {
    return this.props.isLoaded
      ? &lt;div&gt;{&#39;Loaded&#39;}&lt;/div&gt;
      : &lt;div&gt;{&#39;Not Loaded&#39;}&lt;/div&gt;
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) =&gt; ({
  isLoaded: state.isLoaded
})

const mapDispatchToProps = { fetchData }

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use <code>connect()</code> from React Redux?</h3>
<p>You need to follow two steps to use your store in your container:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use <code>mapStateToProps()</code>:</strong> It maps the state variables from your store to the props that you specify.</li>
<li><p><strong>Connect the above props to your container:</strong> The object returned by the <code>mapStateToProps</code> function is connected to the container. You can import <code>connect()</code> from <code>react-redux</code>.</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 import React from &#39;react&#39;
 import { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;</p>
<p> class App extends React.Component {
   render() {</p>
<pre><code> return &lt;div&gt;{this.props.containerData}&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><p>   }
 }</p>
<p> function mapStateToProps(state) {
   return { containerData: state.data }
 }</p>
<p> export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App)
 ```</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to reset state in Redux?</h3>
<p>You need to write a <em>root reducer</em> in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by <code>combineReducers()</code>.</p>
<p>For example, let us take <code>rootReducer()</code> to return the initial state after <code>USER_LOGOUT</code> action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with <code>undefined</code> as the first argument, no matter the action.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const appReducer = combineReducers({
  /* your app&#39;s top-level reducers */
})

const rootReducer = (state, action) =&gt; {
  if (action.type === &#39;USER_LOGOUT&#39;) {
    state = undefined
  }

  return appReducer(state, action)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In case of using <code>redux-persist</code>, you may also need to clean your storage. <code>redux-persist</code> keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const appReducer = combineReducers({
  /* your app&#39;s top-level reducers */
})

const rootReducer = (state, action) =&gt; {
  if (action.type === &#39;USER_LOGOUT&#39;) {
    Object.keys(state).forEach(key =&gt; {
      storage.removeItem(`persist:${key}`)
    })

    state = undefined
  }

  return appReducer(state, action)
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Whats the purpose of <code>at</code> symbol in the Redux connect decorator?</h3>
<p>The <strong>@</strong> symbol is in fact a JavaScript expression used to signify decorators. <em>Decorators</em> make it possible to annotate and modify classes and properties at design time.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take an example setting up Redux without and with a decorator.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Without decorator:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">  import React from &#39;react&#39;
  import * as actionCreators from &#39;./actionCreators&#39;
  import { bindActionCreators } from &#39;redux&#39;
  import { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;

  function mapStateToProps(state) {
    return { todos: state.todos }
  }

  function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
    return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) }
  }

  class MyApp extends React.Component {
    // ...define your main app here
  }

  export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyApp)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>With decorator:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">  import React from &#39;react&#39;
  import * as actionCreators from &#39;./actionCreators&#39;
  import { bindActionCreators } from &#39;redux&#39;
  import { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;

  function mapStateToProps(state) {
    return { todos: state.todos }
  }

  function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
    return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) }
  }

  @connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)
  export default class MyApp extends React.Component {
    // ...define your main app here
  }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above examples are almost similar except the usage of decorator. The decorator syntax isn&#39;t built into any JavaScript runtimes yet, and is still experimental and subject to change. You can use babel for the decorators support.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between React context and React Redux?</h3>
<p>You can use <strong>Context</strong> in your application directly and is going to be great for passing down data to deeply nested components which what it was designed for.</p>
<p>Whereas <strong>Redux</strong> is much more powerful and provides a large number of features that the Context API doesn&#39;t provide. Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn&#39;t expose this fact in the public API.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why are Redux state functions called reducers?</h3>
<p>Reducers always return the accumulation of the state (based on all previous and current actions). Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters. This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. You could <em>reduce</em> a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to make AJAX request in Redux?</h3>
<p>You can use <code>redux-thunk</code> middleware which allows you to define async actions.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take an example of fetching specific account as an AJAX call using <em>fetch API</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">export function fetchAccount(id) {
  return dispatch =&gt; {
    dispatch(setLoadingAccountState()) // Show a loading spinner
    fetch(`/account/${id}`, (response) =&gt; {
      dispatch(doneFetchingAccount()) // Hide loading spinner
      if (response.status === 200) {
        dispatch(setAccount(response.json)) // Use a normal function to set the received state
      } else {
        dispatch(someError)
      }
    })
  }
}

function setAccount(data) {
 return { type: &#39;SET_Account&#39;, data: data }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Should I keep all component&#39;s state in Redux store?</h3>
<p> Keep your data in the Redux store, and the UI related state internally in the component.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the proper way to access Redux store?</h3>
<p>The best way to access your store in a component is to use the <code>connect()</code> function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called <em>Higher-Order Components</em>, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component&#39;s functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take an example of <code>&lt;FilterLink&gt;</code> component using connect:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;
import { setVisibilityFilter } from &#39;../actions&#39;
import Link from &#39;../components/Link&#39;

const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) =&gt; ({
  active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter
})

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) =&gt; ({
  onClick: () =&gt; dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter))
})

const FilterLink = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(Link)

export default FilterLink
</code></pre>
<p>Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using <code>connect()</code> over accessing the store directly (using context API).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent {
  someMethod() {
    doSomethingWith(this.context.store)
  }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between component and container in React Redux?</h3>
<p><strong>Component</strong> is a class or function component that describes the presentational part of your application.</p>
<p><strong>Container</strong> is an informal term for a component that is connected to a Redux store. Containers <em>subscribe</em> to Redux state updates and <em>dispatch</em> actions, and they usually don&#39;t render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of the constants in Redux?</h3>
<p>Constants allows you to easily find all usages of that specific functionality across the project when you use an IDE. It also prevents you from introducing silly bugs caused by typos – in which case, you will get a <code>ReferenceError</code> immediately.</p>
<p>Normally we will save them in a single file (<code>constants.js</code> or <code>actionTypes.js</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">export const ADD_TODO = &#39;ADD_TODO&#39;
export const DELETE_TODO = &#39;DELETE_TODO&#39;
export const EDIT_TODO = &#39;EDIT_TODO&#39;
export const COMPLETE_TODO = &#39;COMPLETE_TODO&#39;
export const COMPLETE_ALL = &#39;COMPLETE_ALL&#39;
export const CLEAR_COMPLETED = &#39;CLEAR_COMPLETED&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>In Redux, you use them in two places:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>During action creation:</strong></p>
<p> Let&#39;s take <code>actions.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> import { ADD_TODO } from &#39;./actionTypes&#39;;

 export function addTodo(text) {
   return { type: ADD_TODO, text }
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>In reducers:</strong></p>
<p> Let&#39;s create <code>reducer.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> import { ADD_TODO } from &#39;./actionTypes&#39;

 export default (state = [], action) =&gt; {
   switch (action.type) {
     case ADD_TODO:
       return [
         ...state,
         {
           text: action.text,
           completed: false
         }
       ];
     default:
       return state
   }
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the different ways to write <code>mapDispatchToProps()</code>?</h3>
<p>There are a few ways of binding <em>action creators</em> to <code>dispatch()</code> in <code>mapDispatchToProps()</code>.</p>
<p>Below are the possible options:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) =&gt; ({
 action: () =&gt; dispatch(action())
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) =&gt; ({
 action: bindActionCreators(action, dispatch)
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const mapDispatchToProps = { action }
</code></pre>
<p>The third option is just a shorthand for the first one.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the use of the <code>ownProps</code> parameter in <code>mapStateToProps()</code> and <code>mapDispatchToProps()</code>?</h3>
<p>If the <code>ownProps</code> parameter is specified, React Redux will pass the props that were passed to the component into your <em>connect</em> functions. So, if you use a connected component:</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import ConnectedComponent from &#39;./containers/ConnectedComponent&#39;;</p>
<p><ConnectedComponent user={'john'} /></p>
<pre><code>
The `ownProps` inside your `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()` functions will be an object:

```javascript
{ user: &#39;john&#39; }
</code></pre><p>You can use this object to decide what to return from those functions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to structure Redux top level directories?</h3>
<p>Most of the applications has several top-level directories as below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: Used for <em>dumb</em> components unaware of Redux.</li>
<li><strong>Containers</strong>: Used for <em>smart</em> components connected to Redux.</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong>: Used for all action creators, where file names correspond to part of the app.</li>
<li><strong>Reducers</strong>: Used for all reducers, where files name correspond to state key.</li>
<li><strong>Store</strong>: Used for store initialization.</li>
</ol>
<p>This structure works well for small and medium size apps.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is redux-saga?</h3>
<p><code>redux-saga</code> is a library that aims to make side effects (asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React/Redux applications easier and better.</p>
<p>It is available in NPM:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-console">$ npm install --save redux-saga
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the mental model of redux-saga?</h3>
<p><em>Saga</em> is like a separate thread in your application, that&#39;s solely responsible for side effects. <code>redux-saga</code> is a redux <em>middleware</em>, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal Redux actions, it has access to the full Redux application state and it can dispatch Redux actions as well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the differences between <code>call()</code> and <code>put()</code> in redux-saga?</h3>
<p>Both <code>call()</code> and <code>put()</code> are effect creator functions. <code>call()</code> function is used to create effect description, which instructs middleware to call the promise. <code>put()</code> function creates an effect, which instructs middleware to dispatch an action to the store.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take example of how these effects work for fetching particular user data.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function* fetchUserSaga(action) {
  // `call` function accepts rest arguments, which will be passed to `api.fetchUser` function.
  // Instructing middleware to call promise, it resolved value will be assigned to `userData` variable
  const userData = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.userId)

  // Instructing middleware to dispatch corresponding action.
  yield put({
    type: &#39;FETCH_USER_SUCCESS&#39;,
    userData
  })
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Redux Thunk?</h3>
<p><em>Redux Thunk</em> middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods <code>dispatch()</code> and <code>getState()</code> as parameters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the differences between <code>redux-saga</code> and <code>redux-thunk</code>?</h3>
<p>Both <em>Redux Thunk</em> and <em>Redux Saga</em> take care of dealing with side effects. In most of the scenarios, Thunk uses <em>Promises</em> to deal with them, whereas Saga uses <em>Generators</em>. Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers, Sagas/Generators are more powerful but you will need to learn them. But both middleware can coexist, so you can start with Thunks and introduce Sagas when/if you need them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Redux DevTools?</h3>
<p><em>Redux DevTools</em> is a live-editing time travel environment for Redux with hot reloading, action replay, and customizable UI. If you don&#39;t want to bother with installing Redux DevTools and integrating it into your project, consider using Redux DevTools Extension for Chrome and Firefox.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the features of Redux DevTools?</h3>
<p>Some of the main features of Redux DevTools are below,</p>
<ol>
<li>Lets you inspect every state and action payload.</li>
<li>Lets you go back in time by <em>cancelling</em> actions.</li>
<li>If you change the reducer code, each <em>staged</em> action will be re-evaluated.</li>
<li>If the reducers throw, you will see during which action this happened, and what the error was.</li>
<li>With <code>persistState()</code> store enhancer, you can persist debug sessions across page reloads.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are Redux selectors and why to use them?</h3>
<p><em>Selectors</em> are functions that take Redux state as an argument and return some data to pass to the component.</p>
<p>For example, to get user details from the state:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const getUserData = state =&gt; state.user.data
</code></pre>
<p>These selectors have two main benefits,</p>
<ol>
<li>The selector can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state</li>
<li>The selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Redux Form?</h3>
<p><em>Redux Form</em> works with React and Redux to enable a form in React to use Redux to store all of its state. Redux Form can be used with raw HTML5 inputs, but it also works very well with common UI frameworks like Material UI, React Widgets and React Bootstrap.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the main features of Redux Form?</h3>
<p>Some of the main features of Redux Form are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Field values persistence via Redux store.</li>
<li>Validation (sync/async) and submission.</li>
<li>Formatting, parsing and normalization of field values.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to add multiple middlewares to Redux?</h3>
<p>You can use <code>applyMiddleware()</code>.</p>
<p>For example, you can add <code>redux-thunk</code> and <code>logger</code> passing them as arguments to <code>applyMiddleware()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from &#39;redux&#39;
const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk, logger)(createStore)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to set initial state in Redux?</h3>
<p>You need to pass initial state as second argument to createStore:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todos: todos,
  visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter
})

const initialState = {
  todos: [{ id: 123, name: &#39;example&#39;, completed: false }]
}

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  initialState
)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How Relay is different from Redux?</h3>
<p>Relay is similar to Redux in that they both use a single store. The main difference is that relay only manages state originated from the server, and all access to the state is used via <em>GraphQL</em> queries (for reading data) and mutations (for changing data). Relay caches the data for you and optimizes data fetching for you, by fetching only changed data and nothing more.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>What is an action in Redux?</h3>
<p><em>Actions</em> are plain JavaScript objects or payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.</p>
<p>For example, let&#39;s take an action which represents adding a new todo item:</p>
<pre><code>{
  type: ADD_TODO,
  text: &#39;Add todo item&#39;
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h2>React Native</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between React Native and React?</h3>
<p><strong>React</strong> is a JavaScript library, supporting both front end web and being run on the server, for building user interfaces and web applications.</p>
<p><strong>React Native</strong> is a mobile framework that compiles to native app components, allowing you to build native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Windows) in JavaScript that allows you to use React to build your components, and implements React under the hood.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to test React Native apps?</h3>
<p>React Native can be tested only in mobile simulators like iOS and Android. You can run the app in your mobile using expo app (<a href="https://expo.io">https://expo.io</a>) Where it syncs using QR code, your mobile and computer should be in same wireless network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to do logging in React Native?</h3>
<p>You can use <code>console.log</code>, <code>console.warn</code>, etc. As of React Native v0.29 you can simply run the following to see logs in the console:</p>
<pre><code>$ react-native log-ios
$ react-native log-android
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to debug your React Native?</h3>
<p>Follow the below steps to debug React Native app:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run your application in the iOS simulator.</li>
<li>Press <code>Command + D</code> and a webpage should open up at <code>http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui</code>.</li>
<li>Enable <em>Pause On Caught Exceptions</em> for a better debugging experience.</li>
<li>Press <code>Command + Option + I</code> to open the Chrome Developer tools, or open it via <code>View</code> -&gt; <code>Developer</code> -&gt; <code>Developer Tools</code>.</li>
<li>You should now be able to debug as you normally would.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>React supported libraries &amp; Integration</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is reselect and how it works?</h3>
<p><em>Reselect</em> is a <strong>selector library</strong> (for Redux) which uses <em>memoization</em> concept. It was originally written to compute derived data from Redux-like applications state, but it can&#39;t be tied to any architecture or library.</p>
<p>Reselect keeps a copy of the last inputs/outputs of the last call, and recomputes the result only if one of the inputs changes. If the the same inputs are provided twice in a row, Reselect returns the cached output. It&#39;s memoization and cache are fully customizable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Flow?</h3>
<p><em>Flow</em> is a <em>static type checker</em> designed to find type errors in JavaScript. Flow types can express much more fine-grained distinctions than traditional type systems. For example, Flow helps you catch errors involving <code>null</code>, unlike most type systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between Flow and PropTypes?</h3>
<p>Flow is a <em>static analysis tool</em> (static checker) which uses a superset of the language, allowing you to add type annotations to all of your code and catch an entire class of bugs at compile time.</p>
<p>PropTypes is a <em>basic type checker</em> (runtime checker) which has been patched onto React. It can&#39;t check anything other than the types of the props being passed to a given component. If you want more flexible typechecking for your entire project Flow/TypeScript are appropriate choices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use Font Awesome icons in React?</h3>
<p>The below steps followed to include Font Awesome in React:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install <code>font-awesome</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-console"> $ npm install --save font-awesome
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Import <code>font-awesome</code> in your <code>index.js</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> import &#39;font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css&#39;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Add Font Awesome classes in <code>className</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> render() {
   return &lt;div&gt;&lt;i className={&#39;fa fa-spinner&#39;} /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is React Dev Tools?</h3>
<p><em>React Developer Tools</em> let you inspect the component hierarchy, including component props and state. It exists both as a browser extension (for Chrome and Firefox), and as a standalone app (works with other environments including Safari, IE, and React Native).</p>
<p>The official extensions available for different browsers or environments.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chrome extension</strong></li>
<li><strong>Firefox extension</strong></li>
<li><strong>Standalone app</strong> (Safari, React Native, etc)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why is DevTools not loading in Chrome for local files?</h3>
<p>If you opened a local HTML file in your browser (<code>file://...</code>) then you must first open <em>Chrome Extensions</em> and check <code>Allow access to file URLs</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use Polymer in React?</h3>
<p>You need to follow below steps to use Polymer in React,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a Polymer element:</p>
<p> ```jsx harmony
 <link rel='import' href='../../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html' />
 Polymer({
   is: &#39;calender-element&#39;,
   ready: function() {</p>
<pre><code> this.textContent = &#39;I am a calender&#39;
</code></pre><p>   }
 })
 ```</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create the Polymer component HTML tag by importing it in a HTML document, e.g. import it in the <code>index.html</code> of your React application:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"> &lt;link rel=&#39;import&#39; href=&#39;./src/polymer-components/calender-element.html&#39;&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Use that element in the JSX file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> import React from &#39;react&#39;

 class MyComponent extends React.Component {
   render() {
     return (
       &lt;calender-element /&gt;
     )
   }
 }

 export default MyComponent
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the advantages of React over Vue.js?</h3>
<p>React has the following advantages over Vue.js:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gives more flexibility in large apps developing.</li>
<li>Easier to test.</li>
<li>Suitable for mobile apps creating.</li>
<li>More information and solutions available.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above list of advantages are purely opinionated and it vary based on the professional experience. But they are helpful as base parameters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between React and Angular?</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s see the difference between React and Angular in a table format.</p>
<p>| React | Angular |
| ----- | ------- |
| React is a library and has only the View layer | Angular is a framework and has complete MVC functionality |
| React handles rendering on the server side | AngularJS renders only on the client side but Angular 2 and above renders on the server side |
| React uses JSX that looks like HTML in JS which can be confusing | Angular follows the template approach for HTML, which makes code shorter and easy to understand |
| React Native, which is a React type to build mobile applications are faster and more stable | Ionic, Angular&#39;s mobile native app is relatively less stable and slower |
| In React, data flows only in one way and hence debugging is easy | In Angular, data flows both way i.e it has two-way data binding between children and parent and hence debugging is often difficult |</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above list of differences are purely opinionated and it vary based on the professional experience. But they are helpful as base parameters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why React tab is not showing up in DevTools?</h3>
<p>When the page loads, <em>React DevTools</em> sets a global named <code>__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__</code>, then React communicates with that hook during initialization. If the website is not using React or if React fails to communicate with DevTools then it won&#39;t show up the tab.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are Styled Components?</h3>
<p><code>styled-components</code> is a JavaScript library for styling React applications. It removes the mapping between styles and components, and lets you write actual CSS augmented with JavaScript.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Give an example of Styled Components?</h3>
<p>Lets create <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Wrapper&gt;</code> components with specific styles for each.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import React from &#39;react&#39;
import styled from &#39;styled-components&#39;

// Create a &lt;Title&gt; component that renders an &lt;h1&gt; which is centered, red and sized at 1.5em
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`

// Create a &lt;Wrapper&gt; component that renders a &lt;section&gt; with some padding and a papayawhip background
const Wrapper = styled.section`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
`
</code></pre>
<p>These two variables, <code>Title</code> and <code>Wrapper</code>, are now components that you can render just like any other react component.</p>
<p><code>jsx harmony
&lt;Wrapper&gt;
  &lt;Title&gt;{&#39;Lets start first styled component!&#39;}&lt;/Title&gt;
&lt;/Wrapper&gt;</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Relay?</h3>
<p>Relay is a JavaScript framework for providing a data layer and client-server communication to web applications using the React view layer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use TypeScript in <code>create-react-app</code> application?</h3>
<p>Starting from react-scripts@2.1.0 or higher, there is a built-in support for typescript. i.e, <code>create-react-app</code> now supports typescript natively. You can just pass <code>--typescript</code> option as below</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npx create-react-app my-app --typescript

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --typescript
</code></pre>
<p>But for lower versions of react scripts, just supply <code>--scripts-version</code> option as <code>react-scripts-ts</code> while you create a new project. <code>react-scripts-ts</code> is a set of adjustments to take the standard <code>create-react-app</code> project pipeline and bring TypeScript into the mix.</p>
<p>Now the project layout should look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>my-app/
├─ .gitignore
├─ images.d.ts
├─ node_modules/
├─ public/
├─ src/
│  └─ ...
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ tsconfig.prod.json
├─ tsconfig.test.json
└─ tslint.json
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the main features of Reselect library?</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s see the main features of Reselect library,</p>
<ol>
<li>Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.</li>
<li>Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.</li>
<li>Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><h4>Give an example of Reselect usage?</h4>
<p>Let&#39;s take calculations and different amounts of a shipment order with the simplified usage of Reselect:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import { createSelector } from &#39;reselect&#39;

const shopItemsSelector = state =&gt; state.shop.items
const taxPercentSelector = state =&gt; state.shop.taxPercent

const subtotalSelector = createSelector(
  shopItemsSelector,
  items =&gt; items.reduce((acc, item) =&gt; acc + item.value, 0)
)

const taxSelector = createSelector(
  subtotalSelector,
  taxPercentSelector,
  (subtotal, taxPercent) =&gt; subtotal * (taxPercent / 100)
)

export const totalSelector = createSelector(
  subtotalSelector,
  taxSelector,
  (subtotal, tax) =&gt; ({ total: subtotal + tax })
)

let exampleState = {
  shop: {
    taxPercent: 8,
    items: [
      { name: &#39;apple&#39;, value: 1.20 },
      { name: &#39;orange&#39;, value: 0.95 },
    ]
  }
}

console.log(subtotalSelector(exampleState)) // 2.15
console.log(taxSelector(exampleState))      // 0.172
console.log(totalSelector(exampleState))    // { total: 2.322 }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Does the statics object work with ES6 classes in React?</h3>
<p>No, <code>statics</code> only works with <code>React.createClass()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">someComponent= React.createClass({
  statics: {
    someMethod: function() {
      // ..
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>But you can write statics inside ES6+ classes as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class Component extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {
    // ...
  }

  static someMethod() {
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>or writing them outside class as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class Component extends React.Component {
   ....
}

Component.propTypes = {...}
Component.someMethod = function(){....}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can Redux only be used with React?</h3>
<p>Redux can be used as a data store for any UI layer. The most common usage is with React and React Native, but there are bindings available for Angular, Angular 2, Vue, Mithril, and more. Redux simply provides a subscription mechanism which can be used by any other code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Do you need to have a particular build tool to use Redux?</h3>
<p>Redux is originally written in ES6 and transpiled for production into ES5 with Webpack and Babel. You should be able to use it regardless of your JavaScript build process. Redux also offers a UMD build that can be used directly without any build process at all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How Redux Form <code>initialValues</code> get updated from state?</h3>
<p>You need to add <code>enableReinitialize : true</code> setting.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const InitializeFromStateForm = reduxForm({
  form: &#39;initializeFromState&#39;,
  enableReinitialize : true
})(UserEdit)
</code></pre>
<p>If your <code>initialValues</code> prop gets updated, your form will update too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How React PropTypes allow different types for one prop?</h3>
<p>You can use <code>oneOfType()</code> method of <code>PropTypes</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the height property can be defined with either <code>string</code> or <code>number</code> type as below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">Component.PropTypes = {
  size: PropTypes.oneOfType([
    PropTypes.string,
    PropTypes.number
  ])
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can I import an SVG file as react component?</h3>
<p>You can import SVG directly as component instead of loading it as a file. This feature is available with <code>react-scripts@2.0.0</code> and higher.</p>
<p>```jsx harmony
import { ReactComponent as Logo } from &#39;./logo.svg&#39;</p>
<p>const App = () =&gt; (
  <div></p>
<pre><code>{/* Logo is an actual react component */}
&lt;Logo /&gt;
</code></pre><p>  &lt;/div&gt;
)
```</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Don&#39;t forget about the curly braces in the import.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why are inline ref callbacks or functions not recommended?</h3>
<p>If the ref callback is defined as an inline function, it will get called twice during updates, first with null and then again with the DOM element. This is because a new instance of the function is created with each render, so React needs to clear the old ref and set up the new one.</p>
<p>```jsx
class UserForm extends Component {
  handleSubmit = () =&gt; {</p>
<pre><code>console.log(&quot;Input Value is: &quot;, this.input.value)
</code></pre><p>  }</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>   render () {
    return (
      &lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}&gt;
        &lt;input
          type=&#39;text&#39;
          ref={(input) =&gt; this.input = input} /&gt; // Access DOM input in handle submit
        &lt;button type=&#39;submit&#39;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    )
  }
 }
 ```

 But our expectation is for the ref callback to get called once, when the component mounts. One quick fix is to use the ES7 class property syntax to define the function

 ```jsx
 class UserForm extends Component {
  handleSubmit = () =&gt; {
    console.log(&quot;Input Value is: &quot;, this.input.value)
  }

  setSearchInput = (input) =&gt; {
    this.input = input
  }

  render () {
    return (
      &lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}&gt;
        &lt;input
          type=&#39;text&#39;
          ref={this.setSearchInput} /&gt; // Access DOM input in handle submit
        &lt;button type=&#39;submit&#39;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    )
  }
 }

<li><h3>What is render hijacking in react?</h3>
<p>The concept of render hijacking is the ability to control what a component will output from another component. It actually means that you decorate your component by wrapping it into a Higher-Order component. By wrapping you can inject additional props or make other changes, which can cause changing logic of rendering. It does not actually enables hijacking, but by using HOC you make your component behave in different way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are HOC factory implementations?</h3>
<p>There are two main ways of implementing HOCs in React.</p>
<ol>
<li>Props Proxy (PP) and</li>
<li>Inheritance Inversion (II).</li>
</ol>
<p>But they follow different approaches for manipulating the <em>WrappedComponent</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Props Proxy</strong></p>
<p>In this approach, the render method of the HOC returns a React Element of the type of the WrappedComponent. We also pass through the props that the HOC receives, hence the name <strong>Props Proxy</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">
function ppHOC(WrappedComponent) {
 return class PP extends React.Component {
   render() {
     return &lt;WrappedComponent {...this.props}/&gt;
   }
 }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Inheritance Inversion</strong></p>
<p>In this approach, the returned HOC class (Enhancer) extends the WrappedComponent. It is called Inheritance Inversion because instead of the WrappedComponent extending some Enhancer class, it is passively extended by the Enhancer. In this way the relationship between them seems <strong>inverse</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">function iiHOC(WrappedComponent) {
 return class Enhancer extends WrappedComponent {
   render() {
     return super.render()
   }
 }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to pass numbers to React component?</h3>
<p>You should be passing the numbers via curly braces({}) where as strings in quotes</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">   React.render(&lt;User age={30} department={&quot;IT&quot;} /&gt;, document.getElementById(&#39;container&#39;));
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Do I need to keep all my state into Redux? Should I ever use react internal state?</h3>
<p>It is up to developer decision. i.e, It is developer job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component&#39;s internal state.</p>
<p>Below are the thumb rules to determine what kind of data should be put into Redux</p>
<ol>
<li>Do other parts of the application care about this data?</li>
<li>Do you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data?</li>
<li>Is the same data being used to drive multiple components?</li>
<li>Is there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)?</li>
<li>Do you want to cache the data (i.e, use what&#39;s in state if it&#39;s already there instead of re-requesting it)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of registerServiceWorker in React?</h3>
<p>React creates a service worker for you without any configuration by default. The service worker is a web API that helps you cache your assets and other files so that when the user is offline or on slow network, he/she can still see results on the screen, as such, it helps you build a better user experience, that&#39;s what you should know about service worker&#39;s for now. It&#39;s all about adding offline capabilities to your site.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">   import React from &#39;react&#39;;
   import ReactDOM from &#39;react-dom&#39;;
   import App from &#39;./App&#39;;
   import registerServiceWorker from &#39;./registerServiceWorker&#39;;

   ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;));
   registerServiceWorker();
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is React memo function?</h3>
<p>Class components can be restricted from rendering when their input props are the same using <strong>PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate</strong>. Now you can do the same with function components by wrapping them in <strong>React.memo</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
 /* only rerenders if props change */
});
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is React lazy function?</h3>
<p>The <code>React.lazy</code> function lets you render an dynamic import as a regular component. It will automatically load the bundle containing the OtherComponent when the component gets rendered. This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() =&gt; import(&#39;./OtherComponent&#39;));

function MyComponent() {
 return (
   &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;OtherComponent /&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
 );
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
React.lazy and Suspense is not yet available for server-side rendering. If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, we still recommend React Loadable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to prevent unnecessary updates using setState?</h3>
<p>You can compare current value of the state with an existing state value and decide whether to rerender the page or not. If the values are same then you need to return <strong>null</strong> to stop re-rendering otherwise return the latest state value.</p>
<p>For example, the user profile information is conditionally rendered as follows,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">getUserProfile = user =&gt; {
  const latestAddress = user.address;
  this.setState(state =&gt; {
    if (state.address === latestAddress) {
      return null;
    } else {
      return { title: latestAddress };
    }
  });
};
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you render Array, Strings and Numbers in React 16 Version?</h3>
<p><strong>Arrays</strong>: Unlike older releases, you don&#39;t need to make sure <strong>render</strong> method return a single element in React16. You are able to return multiple sibling elements without a wrapping element by returning an array.</p>
<p>For example, let us take the below list of developers,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">const ReactJSDevs = () =&gt; {
  return [
    &lt;li key=&quot;1&quot;&gt;John&lt;/li&gt;,
    &lt;li key=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Jackie&lt;/li&gt;,
    &lt;li key=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Jordan&lt;/li&gt;
  ];
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can also merge this array of items in another array component.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">const JSDevs = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brad&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brodge&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;ReactJSDevs/&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brandon&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Strings and Numbers:</strong> You can also return string and number type from the render method.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">render() {
 return &#39;Welcome to ReactJS questions&#39;;
}
// Number
render() {
 return 2018;
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to use class field declarations syntax in React classes?</h3>
<p>React Class Components can be made much more concise using the class field declarations. You can initialize local state without using the constructor and declare class methods by using arrow functions without the extra need to bind them.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a counter example to demonstrate class field declarations for state without using constructor and methods without binding,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">class Counter extends Component {
  state = { value: 0 };

  handleIncrement = () =&gt; {
    this.setState(prevState =&gt; ({
      value: prevState.value + 1
    }));
  };

  handleDecrement = () =&gt; {
    this.setState(prevState =&gt; ({
      value: prevState.value - 1
    }));
  };

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        {this.state.value}

        &lt;button onClick={this.handleIncrement}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={this.handleDecrement}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are hooks?</h3>
<p>Hooks is a new feature(React 16.8) that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see an example of useState hook example,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsx">import { useState } from &#39;react&#39;;

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we&#39;ll call &quot;count&quot;
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Click me
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the rules needs to follow for hooks?</h3>
<p>You need to follow two rules in order to use hooks,</p>
<ol>
<li>Call Hooks only at the top level of your react functions. i.e, You shouldn’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.</li>
<li>Call Hooks from React Functions only. i.e, You shouldn’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to ensure hooks followed the rules in your project?</h3>
React team released an ESLint plugin called <strong>eslint-plugin-react-hooks</strong> that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project using the below command,<pre><code class="lang-javascript">npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks@next
</code></pre>
And apply the below config in your ESLint config file,<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// Your ESLint configuration
{
  &quot;plugins&quot;: [
    // ...
    &quot;react-hooks&quot;
  ],
  &quot;rules&quot;: {
    // ...
    &quot;react-hooks/rules-of-hooks&quot;: &quot;error&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<strong>Note:</strong> This plugin is intended to use in Create React App by default.</li>

<li><h3>What are the differences between Flux and Redux?</h3>
<p>Below are the major differences between Flux and Redux</p>
<p>| Flux | Redux |
| ----- | ------- |
| State is mutable | State is immutable |
| The Store contains both state and change logic | The Store and change logic are separate |
| There are multiple stores exist | There is only one store exist |
| All the stores are disconnected and flat | Single store with hierarchical reducers|
| It has a singleton dispatcher | There is no concept of dispatcher |
| React components subscribe to the store | Container components uses connect function|</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the benefits of React Router V4?</h3>
<p>Below are the main benefits of React Router V4 module,</p>
<ol>
<li>In React Router v4(version 4), the API is completely about components. A router can be visualized as a single component(<code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code>) which wraps specific child router components(<code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>You don&#39;t need to manually set history. The router module will take care history by wrapping routes with  <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> component.</li>
<li>The application size is reduced by adding only the specific router module(Web, core, or native)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can you describe about componentDidCatch lifecycle method signature?</h3>
<p>The <strong>componentDidCatch</strong> lifecycle method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. The method receives two parameters,</p>
<ol>
<li>error: - The error object which was thrown</li>
<li>info: - An object with a componentStack key contains the information about which component threw the error.</li>
</ol>
<p>The method structure would be as follows</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">componentDidCatch(error, info)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>In which scenarios error boundaries do not catch errors?</h3>
<p>Below are the cases in which error boundaries doesn&#39;t work,</p>
<ol>
<li>Inside Event handlers</li>
<li>Asynchronous code using <strong>setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame</strong> callbacks</li>
<li>During Server side rendering</li>
<li>When errors thrown in the error boundary code itself</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why do not you need error boundaries for event handlers?</h3>
<p>Error boundaries do not catch errors inside event handlers. Event handlers don&#39;t happened or invoked during rendering time unlike render method or lifecycle methods. So React knows how to recover these kind of errors in event handlers.
If still you need to catch an error inside event handler, use the regular JavaScript try / catch statement as below</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { error: null };
  }

  handleClick = () =&gt; {
    try {
      // Do something that could throw
    } catch (error) {
      this.setState({ error });
    }
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.error) {
      return &lt;h1&gt;Caught an error.&lt;/h1&gt;
    }
    return &lt;div onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;Click Me&lt;/div&gt;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is catching the error using vanilla javascript try/catch block instead of error boundaries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between try catch block and error boundaries?</h3>
<p>Try catch block works with imperative code whereas error boundaries are meant for declarative code to render on the screen.</p>
<p>For example, the try catch block used for below imperative code</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">try {
  showButton();
} catch (error) {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas error boundaries wrap declarative code as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;ErrorBoundary&gt;
  &lt;MyComponent /&gt;
&lt;/ErrorBoundary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So if an error occurs in a <strong>componentDidUpdate</strong> method caused by a <strong>setState</strong> somewhere deep in the tree, it will still correctly propagate to the closest error boundary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the behavior of uncaught errors in react 16?</h3>
In React 16, errors that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree. The reason behind this decision is that it is worse to leave corrupted UI in place than to completely remove it. For example, it is worse for a payments app to display a wrong amount than to render nothing.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the proper placement for error boundaries?</h3>
The granularity of error boundaries usage is up to the developer based on project needs. You can follow either of these approaches,<ol>
<li>You can wrap top-level route components to display a generic error message for the entire application.</li>
<li>You can also wrap individual components in an error boundary to protect them from crashing the rest of the application.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the benefit of component stack trace from error boundary?</h3>
<p>Apart from error messages and javascript stack, React16 will display the component stack trace with file names and line numbers using error boundary concept.</p>
<p>For example, BuggyCounter component displays the component stack trace as below,</p>
<p><img src="images/error_boundary.png" alt="stacktrace"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the required method to be defined for a class component?</h3>
The <code>render()</code> method is the only required method in a class component. i.e, All methods other than render method are optional for a class component.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the possible return types of render method?</h3>
<p>Below are the list of following types used and return from render method,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>React elements:</strong> Elements that instruct React to render a DOM node. It includes html elements such as <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code> and user defined elements.</li>
<li><strong>Arrays and fragments:</strong> Return multiple elements to render as Arrays and Fragments to wrap multiple elements</li>
<li><strong>Portals:</strong> Render children into a different DOM subtree.</li>
<li><strong>String and numbers:</strong> Render both Strings and Numbers as text nodes in the DOM</li>
<li><strong>Booleans or null:</strong> Doesn&#39;t render anything but these types are used to conditionally render content.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the main purpose of constructor?</h3>
<p>The constructor is mainly used for two purposes,</p>
<ol>
<li>To initialize local state by assigning object to this.state</li>
<li>For binding event handler methods to the instance
For example, the below code covers both the above cases,<pre><code class="lang-javascript">constructor(props) {
super(props);
// Don&#39;t call this.setState() here!
this.state = { counter: 0 };
this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is it mandatory to define constructor for React component?</h3>
No, it is not mandatory. i.e, If you don’t initialize state and you don’t bind methods, you don’t need to implement a constructor for your React component.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are default props?</h3>
<p>The defaultProps are defined as a property on the component class to set the default props for the class. This is used for undefined props, but not for null props.</p>
<p>For example, let us create color default prop for the button component,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class MyButton extends React.Component {
  // ...
}

MyButton.defaultProps = {
  color: &#39;red&#39;
};
</code></pre>
<p>If props.color is not provided then it will set the default value to &#39;red&#39;. i.e, Whenever you try to access the color prop it uses default value</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">render() {
   return &lt;MyButton /&gt; ; // props.color will be set to red
 }
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you provide null value then it remains null value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why should not call setState in componentWillUnmount?</h3>
You should not call <code>setState()</code> in <code>componentWillUnmount()</code> because once a component instance is unmounted, it will never be mounted again.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of getDerivedStateFromError?</h3>
<p>This lifecycle method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. It receives the error that was thrown as a parameter and should return a value to update state.</p>
<p>The signature of the lifecycle method is as follows,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
</code></pre>
<p>Let us take error boundary use case with the above lifecycle method for demonistration purpose,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return &lt;h1&gt;Something went wrong.&lt;/h1&gt;;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the methods order when component re-rendered?</h3>
<p>An update can be caused by changes to props or state. The below methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered.</p>
<ol>
<li>static getDerivedStateFromProps()</li>
<li>shouldComponentUpdate()</li>
<li>render()</li>
<li>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</li>
<li>componentDidUpdate()</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the methods invoked during error handling?</h3>
<p>Below methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.</p>
<ol>
<li>static getDerivedStateFromError()</li>
<li>componentDidCatch()</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of displayName class property?</h3>
<p>The displayName string is used in debugging messages. Usually, you don’t need to set it explicitly because it’s inferred from the name of the function or class that defines the component. You might want to set it explicitly if you want to display a different name for debugging purposes or when you create a higher-order component.</p>
<p>For example, To ease debugging, choose a display name that communicates that it’s the result of a withSubscription HOC.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function withSubscription(WrappedComponent) {
  class WithSubscription extends React.Component {/* ... */}
  WithSubscription.displayName = `WithSubscription(${getDisplayName(WrappedComponent)})`;
  return WithSubscription;
}
function getDisplayName(WrappedComponent) {
  return WrappedComponent.displayName || WrappedComponent.name || &#39;Component&#39;;
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the browser support for react applications?</h3>
React supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above, although some polyfills are required for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10. If you use  <strong>es5-shim and es5-sham</strong> polyfill then it even support old browsers that doesn&#39;t support ES5 methods.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of unmountComponentAtNode method?</h3>
<p>This method is available from react-dom package and it removes a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state. If no component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing. Returns true if a component was unmounted and false if there was no component to unmount.</p>
<p>The method signature would be as follows,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is code-splitting?</h3>
<p>Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack and Browserify which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. The react project supports code splitting via dynamic import() feature.</p>
<p>For example, in the below code snippets, it will make moduleA.js and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the &#39;Load&#39; button.
<strong>moduleA.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const moduleA = &#39;Hello&#39;;

export { moduleA };
</code></pre>
<p><strong>App.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;

class App extends Component {
  handleClick = () =&gt; {
    import(&#39;./moduleA&#39;)
      .then(({ moduleA }) =&gt; {
        // Use moduleA
      })
      .catch(err =&gt; {
        // Handle failure
      });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;Load&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default App;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the benefit of strict mode?</h3>
<p>The <StrictMode> will be  helpful in the below cases</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying components with <strong>unsafe lifecycle methods</strong>.</li>
<li>Warning about <strong>legacy string ref</strong> API usage.</li>
<li>Detecting unexpected <strong>side effects</strong>.</li>
<li>Detecting <strong>legacy context</strong> API.</li>
<li>Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are Keyed Fragments?</h3>
<p>The Fragments declared with the explicit <React.Fragment> syntax may have keys. The general use case is mapping a collection to an array of fragments as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function Glossary(props) {
  return (
    &lt;dl&gt;
      {props.items.map(item =&gt; (
        // Without the `key`, React will fire a key warning
        &lt;React.Fragment key={item.id}&gt;
          &lt;dt&gt;{item.term}&lt;/dt&gt;
          &lt;dd&gt;{item.description}&lt;/dd&gt;
        &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/dl&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> key is the only attribute that can be passed to Fragment. In the future, there might be a support for additional attributes, such as event handlers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Does React support all HTML attributes?</h3>
<p>As of React 16, both standard or custom DOM attributes are fully supported. Since React components often take both custom and DOM-related props, React uses the camelCase convention just like the DOM APIs.</p>
<p>Let us take few props with respect to standard HTML attributes,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;div tabIndex=&quot;-1&quot; /&gt;      // Just like node.tabIndex DOM API
&lt;div className=&quot;Button&quot; /&gt; // Just like node.className DOM API
&lt;input readOnly={true} /&gt;  // Just like node.readOnly DOM API
</code></pre>
<p>These props work similarly to the corresponding HTML attributes, with the exception of the special cases. It also support all SVG attributes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the limitations with HOCs?</h3>
<p>Higher-order components come with a few caveats apart from its benefits. Below are the few listed in an order,</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Don’t use HOCs inside the render method:</strong>
It is not recommended to apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">render() {
  // A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render
  // EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2
  const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);
  // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!
  return &lt;EnhancedComponent /&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The above code impact performance by remounting a component that causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost. Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Static methods must be copied over:</strong>
When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// Define a static method
WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function() {/*...*/}
// Now apply a HOC
const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);

// The enhanced component has no static method
typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === &#39;undefined&#39; // true
</code></pre>
<p>You can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function enhance(WrappedComponent) {
  class Enhance extends React.Component {/*...*/}
  // Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(
  Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;
  return Enhance;
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Refs aren’t passed through:</strong>
For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs. This is because ref is not really a prop similar to key. In this case you need to use the React.forwardRef API</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to debug forwardRefs in DevTools?</h3>
<p><strong>React.forwardRef</strong> accepts a render function as parameter and DevTools uses this function to determine what to display for the ref forwarding component.</p>
<p>For example, If you don&#39;t name the render function or not using displayName property then it will appear as ”ForwardRef” in the DevTools,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) =&gt; {
  return &lt;LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} /&gt;;
});
</code></pre>
<p>But If you name the render function then it will appear as <strong>”ForwardRef(myFunction)”</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef(
  function myFunction(props, ref) {
    return &lt;LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} /&gt;;
  }
);
</code></pre>
<p>As an alternative, You can also set displayName property for forwardRef function,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function logProps(Component) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    // ...
  }

  function forwardRef(props, ref) {
    return &lt;LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} /&gt;;
  }

  // Give this component a more helpful display name in DevTools.
  // e.g. &quot;ForwardRef(logProps(MyComponent))&quot;
  const name = Component.displayName || Component.name;
  forwardRef.displayName = `logProps(${name})`;

  return React.forwardRef(forwardRef);
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>When component props defaults to true?</h3>
<p>If you pass no value for a prop, it defaults to true. This behavior is available so that it matches the behavior of HTML.</p>
<p>For example, below expressions are equivalent,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;MyInput autocomplete /&gt;

&lt;MyInput autocomplete={true} /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not recommended to use this approach because it can be confused with the ES6 object shorthand (example, <code>{name}</code> which is short for <code>{name: name}</code>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is NextJS and major features of it?</h3>
<p>Next.js is a popular and lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applications built with React. It also provides styling and routing solutions. Below are the major features provided by NextJS,</p>
<ol>
<li>Server-rendered by default</li>
<li>Automatic code splitting for faster page loads</li>
<li>Simple client-side routing (page based)</li>
<li>Webpack-based dev environment which supports (HMR)</li>
<li>Able to implement with Express or any other Node.js HTTP server</li>
<li>Customizable with your own Babel and Webpack configurations</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you pass an event handler to a component?</h3>
<p>You can pass event handlers and other functions as props to child components. It can be used in child component as  below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is it good to use arrow functions in render methods?</h3>
<p>Yes, You can use. It is often the easiest way to pass parameters to callback functions. But you need to optimize the performance while using it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class Foo extends Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log(&#39;Click happened&#39;);
  }
  render() {
    return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; this.handleClick()}&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using an arrow function in render method creates a new function each time the component renders, which may have performance implications</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to prevent a function from being called multiple times?</h3>
<p>If you use an event handler such as <strong>onClick or onScroll</strong> and want to prevent the callback from being fired too quickly, then you can limit the rate at which callback is executed. This can be achieved in the below possible ways,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Throttling:</strong> Changes based on a time based frequency. For example, it can be used using _.throttle lodash function</li>
<li><strong>Debouncing:</strong> Publish changes after a period of inactivity. For example, it can be used using _.debounce lodash function</li>
<li><strong>RequestAnimationFrame throttling:</strong> Changes based on requestAnimationFrame. For example, it can be used using raf-schd lodash function</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How JSX prevents Injection Attacks?</h3>
<p>React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered.</p>
<p>For example, you can embed user input as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const name = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
const element = &lt;h1&gt;{name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>This way you can prevent XSS(Cross-site-scripting) attacks in the application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you update rendered elements?</h3>
<p>You can update UI(represented by rendered element) by passing the newly created element to ReactDOM&#39;s render method.</p>
<p>For example, lets take a ticking clock example, where it updates the time by calling render method multiple times,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function tick() {
  const element = (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you say that props are read only?</h3>
<p>When you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props.</p>
<p>Let us take a below capital function,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function capital(amount, interest) {
   return amount + interest;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The above function is called “pure” because it does not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs. Hence, React has a single rule saying &quot;All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you say that state updates are merged?</h3>
<p>When you call setState() in the component, React merges the object you provide into the current state.</p>
<p>For example, let us take a facebook user with posts and comments details as state variables,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      posts: [],
      comments: []
    };
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can update them independently with separate <code>setState()</code> calls as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> componentDidMount() {
    fetchPosts().then(response =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        posts: response.posts
      });
    });

    fetchComments().then(response =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        comments: response.comments
      });
    });
  }
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned in the above code snippets, <code>this.setState({comments})</code> updates only comments variable without modifying or replacing posts variable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you pass arguments to an event handler?</h3>
<p>During iterations or loops, it is common to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. This can be achieved through arrow functions or bind method.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of user details updated in a grid,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;button onClick={(e) =&gt; this.updateUser(userId, e)}&gt;Update User details&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button onClick={this.updateUser.bind(this, userId)}&gt;Update User details&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In both the approaches, the synthetic argument e is passed as a second argument. You need to pass it explicitly for arrow functions and it forwarded automatically for bind method.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to prevent component from rendering?</h3>
<p>You can prevent component from rendering by returning null based on specific condition. This way it can conditionally render component.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function Greeting(props) {
  if (!props.loggedIn) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;greeting&quot;&gt;
      welcome, {props.name}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {loggedIn: false, name: &#39;John&#39;};
  }

  render() {
   return (
       &lt;div&gt;
         //Prevent component render if it is not loggedIn
         &lt;Greeting loggedIn={this.state.loggedIn} /&gt;
         &lt;UserDetails name={this.state.name}&gt;
       &lt;/div&gt;
   );
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the greeting component skips its rendering section by applying condition and returning null value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the conditions to safely use the index as a key?</h3>
<p>There are three conditions to make sure, it is safe use the index as a key.</p>
<ol>
<li>The list and items are static– they are not computed and do not change</li>
<li>The items in the list have no ids</li>
<li>The list is never reordered or filtered.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is it keys should be globally unique?</h3>
<p>Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings but they don’t need to be globally unique. i.e, You can use the same keys with two different arrays.</p>
<p>For example, the below book component uses two arrays with different arrays,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function Book(props) {
  const index = (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {props.pages.map((page) =&gt;
        &lt;li key={page.id}&gt;
          {page.title}
        &lt;/li&gt;
      )}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
  const content = props.pages.map((page) =&gt;
    &lt;div key={page.id}&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;{page.title}&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;{page.content}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;{page.pageNumber}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {index}
      &lt;hr /&gt;
      {content}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the popular choice for form handling?</h3>
<p><code>Formik</code> is a form library for react which provides solutions such as validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission.</p>
<p>In detail, You can categorize them as follows,</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting values in and out of form state</li>
<li>Validation and error messages</li>
<li>Handling form submission</li>
</ol>
<p>It is used to create a scalable, performant, form helper with a minimal API to solve annoying stuff.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the advantages of formik over redux form library?</h3>
<p>Below are the main reasons to recommend formik over redux form library,</p>
<ol>
<li>The form state is inherently short-term and local, so tracking it in Redux (or any kind of Flux library) is unnecessary.</li>
<li>Redux-Form calls your entire top-level Redux reducer multiple times ON EVERY SINGLE KEYSTROKE. This way it increases input latency for large apps.</li>
<li>Redux-Form is 22.5 kB minified gzipped whereas Formik is 12.7 kB</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why do you not required to use inheritance?</h3>
In React, it is recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components. Both Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.
Whereas, If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, it is suggested to extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. Later components import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can I use web components in react application?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can use web components in a react application. Even though many developers won&#39;t use this combination, it may require especially if you are using third-party UI components that are written using Web Components.</p>
<p>For example, let us use <code>Vaadin</code> date picker web component as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;
import &#39;./App.css&#39;;
import &#39;@vaadin/vaadin-date-picker&#39;;
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
        &lt;vaadin-date-picker label=&quot;When were you born?&quot;&gt;&lt;/vaadin-date-picker&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
export default App;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is dynamic import?</h3>
<p>The dynamic import() syntax is a ECMAScript proposal not currently part of the language standard. It is expected to be accepted in the near future. You can achieve code-splitting into your app using dynamic import.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take an example of addition,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Normal Import</strong><pre><code class="lang-javascript">import { add } from &#39;./math&#39;;
console.log(add(10, 20));
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Import</strong><pre><code class="lang-javascript">import(&quot;./math&quot;).then(math =&gt; {
console.log(math.add(10, 20));
});
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are loadable components?</h3>
<p>If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, it is recommend to use Loadable Components because React.lazy and Suspense is not yet available for server-side rendering. Loadable lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.</p>
<p>Lets take an example,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import loadable from &#39;@loadable/component&#39;

const OtherComponent = loadable(() =&gt; import(&#39;./OtherComponent&#39;))

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;OtherComponent /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now OtherComponent will be loaded in a separated bundle</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is suspense component?</h3>
<p>If the module containing the dynamic import is not yet loaded by the time parent component renders, you must show some fallback content while you’re waiting for it to load using a loading indicator. This can be done using <strong>Suspense</strong> component.</p>
<p>For example, the below code uses suspense component,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() =&gt; import(&#39;./OtherComponent&#39;));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
        &lt;OtherComponent /&gt;
      &lt;/Suspense&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned in the above code, Suspense is wrapped above the lazy component.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is route based code splitting?</h3>
<p>One of the best place to do code splitting is with routes. The entire page is going to re-render at once so users are unlikely to interact with other elements in the page at the same time. Due to this, the user experience won&#39;t be disturbed.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of route based website using libraries like React Router with React.lazy,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from &#39;react-router-dom&#39;;
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from &#39;react&#39;;

const Home = lazy(() =&gt; import(&#39;./routes/Home&#39;));
const About = lazy(() =&gt; import(&#39;./routes/About&#39;));

const App = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Router&gt;
    &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
      &lt;Switch&gt;
        &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/&quot; component={Home}/&gt;
        &lt;Route path=&quot;/about&quot; component={About}/&gt;
      &lt;/Switch&gt;
    &lt;/Suspense&gt;
  &lt;/Router&gt;
);
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, the code splitting will happen at each route level.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Give an example on How to use context?</h3>
<p><strong>Context</strong> is designed to share data that can be considered <strong>global</strong> for a tree of React components.</p>
<p>For example, in the code below lets manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">//Lets create a context with a default theme value &quot;luna&quot;
const ThemeContext = React.createContext(&#39;luna&#39;);
// Create App component where it uses provider to pass theme value in the tree
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;ThemeContext.Provider value=&quot;nova&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Toolbar /&gt;
      &lt;/ThemeContext.Provider&gt;
    );
  }
}
// A middle component where you don&#39;t need to pass theme prop anymore
function Toolbar(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;ThemedButton /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
// Lets read theme value in the button component to use
class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  static contextType = ThemeContext;
  render() {
    return &lt;Button theme={this.context} /&gt;;
  }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of default value in context?</h3>
<p>The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them.</p>
<p>Below code snippet provides default theme value as Luna.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you use contextType?</h3>
<p>ContextType is used to consume the context object. The contextType property can be used in two ways,</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>contextType as property of class:</strong>
 The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). After that, you can consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context in any of the lifecycle methods and render function.</p>
<p> Lets assign contextType property on MyClass as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> class MyClass extends React.Component {
   componentDidMount() {
     let value = this.context;
     /* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext */
   }
   componentDidUpdate() {
     let value = this.context;
     /* ... */
   }
   componentWillUnmount() {
     let value = this.context;
     /* ... */
   }
   render() {
     let value = this.context;
     /* render something based on the value of MyContext */
   }
 }
 MyClass.contextType = MyContext;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Static field</strong>
 You can use a static class field to initialize your contextType using public class field syntax.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> class MyClass extends React.Component {
   static contextType = MyContext;
   render() {
     let value = this.context;
     /* render something based on the value */
   }
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is a consumer?</h3>
<p>A Consumer is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It requires a function as a child which receives current context value as argument and returns a react node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.</p>
<p>Lets take a simple example,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;MyContext.Consumer&gt;
  {value =&gt; /* render something based on the context value */}
&lt;/MyContext.Consumer&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you solve performance corner cases while using context?</h3>
<p>The context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider’s parent re-renders.</p>
<p>For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code> This can be solved by lifting up the value to parent state,

 ```javascript
 class App extends React.Component {
   constructor(props) {
     super(props);
     this.state = {
       value: {something: &#39;something&#39;},
     };
   }

   render() {
     return (
       &lt;Provider value={this.state.value}&gt;
         &lt;Toolbar /&gt;
       &lt;/Provider&gt;
     );
   }
 }
 ```
</code></pre><ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of forward ref in HOCs?</h3>
<p>Refs will not get passed through because ref is not a prop. It handled differently by React just like <strong>key</strong>. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.</p>
<p>The below HOC logs all props,</p>
<pre><code>```javascript
function logProps(Component) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
      console.log(&#39;old props:&#39;, prevProps);
      console.log(&#39;new props:&#39;, this.props);
    }

    render() {
      const {forwardedRef, ...rest} = this.props;

      // Assign the custom prop &quot;forwardedRef&quot; as a ref
      return &lt;Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} /&gt;;
    }
  }

  return React.forwardRef((props, ref) =&gt; {
    return &lt;LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} /&gt;;
  });
}
```
</code></pre><p>Let&#39;s use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our “fancy button” component,</p>
<pre><code>```javascript
class FancyButton extends React.Component {
  focus() {
    // ...
  }

  // ...
}
export default logProps(FancyButton);
```
</code></pre><p>Now lets create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.</p>
<pre><code>```javascript
import FancyButton from &#39;./FancyButton&#39;;

const ref = React.createRef();
ref.current.focus();
&lt;FancyButton
  label=&quot;Click Me&quot;
  handleClick={handleClick}
  ref={ref}
/&gt;;
```
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is it ref argument available for all functions or class components?</h3>
Regular function or class components don’t receive the ref argument, and ref is not available in props either. The second ref argument only exists when you define a component with React.forwardRef call.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why do you need additional care for component libraries while using forward refs?</h3>
When you start using forwardRef in a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library. This is because your library likely has a different behavior such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported. These changes can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to create react class components without ES6?</h3>
<p>If you don’t use ES6 then you may need to use the create-react-class module instead. For default props, you need to define getDefaultProps() as a function on the passed object. Whereas for initial state, you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var Greeting = createReactClass({
  getDefaultProps: function() {
      return {
        name: &#39;Jhohn&#39;
      };
    },
  getInitialState: function() {
      return {message: this.props.message};
    },
  handleClick: function() {
     console.log(this.state.message);
  },
  render: function() {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use createReactClass then auto binding is available for all methods. i.e, You don&#39;t need to use <code>.bind(this)</code> with in constructor for event handlers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is it possible to use react without JSX?</h3>
<p>Yes, JSX is not mandatory for using React. Actually it is convenient when you don’t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling <code>React.createElement(component, props, ...children)</code>.</p>
<p>For example, let us take a greeting example with JSX,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return &lt;div&gt;Hello {this.props.message}&lt;/div&gt;;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Greeting message=&quot;World&quot; /&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);
</code></pre>
<p>You can write the same code without JSX as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.createElement(&#39;div&#39;, null, `Hello ${this.props.message}`);
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Greeting, {message: &#39;World&#39;}, null),
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is diffing algorithm?</h3>
<p>React needs to use algorithms to find out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree. The diffing algorithms is generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n3) where n is the number of elements in the tree.</p>
<p>In this case, for displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two elements of different types will produce different trees.</li>
<li>The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?</h3>
<p>When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Elements Of Different Types:</strong>
Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example,  elements <a> to <img>, or from <Article> to <Comment> of different types lead a full rebuild.</li>
<li><p><strong>DOM Elements Of The Same Type:</strong>
When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;div className=&quot;show&quot; title=&quot;ReactJS&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div className=&quot;hide&quot; title=&quot;ReactJS&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Component Elements Of The Same Type:</strong>
When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.</li>
<li><p><strong>Recursing On Children:</strong>
when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;second&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;third&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Handling keys:</strong>
React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,
```javascript<ul>
<li key="2015">Duke</li>
<li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ol>
<p><ul>
  <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
```</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>When do you need to use refs?</h3>
<p>There are few use cases to go for refs,</p>
<ol>
<li>Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.</li>
<li>Triggering imperative animations.</li>
<li>Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is it prop must be named as render for render props?</h3>
<p>Even though the pattern named render props, you don’t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. i.e,  Any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a “render prop”. Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;Mouse children={mouse =&gt; (
  &lt;p&gt;The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}&lt;/p&gt;
)}/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Actually children prop doesn’t need to be named in the list of “attributes” in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;Mouse&gt;
  {mouse =&gt; (
    &lt;p&gt;The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}&lt;/p&gt;
  )}
&lt;/Mouse&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">Mouse.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the problems of using render props with pure components?</h3>
If you create a function inside a render method, it negates the purpose of pure component. Because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop. You can solve this issue by defining the render function as instance method.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you create HOC using render props?</h3>
<p>You can implement most higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop. For example, if you would prefer to have a withMouse HOC instead of a <Mouse> component, you could easily create one using a regular <Mouse> with a render prop.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function withMouse(Component) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        &lt;Mouse render={mouse =&gt; (
          &lt;Component {...this.props} mouse={mouse} /&gt;
        )}/&gt;
      );
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This way render props gives the flexibility of using either pattern.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is windowing technique?</h3>
Windowing is a technique that only renders a small subset of your rows at any given time, and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created. If your application renders long lists of data then this technique is recommended. Both react-window and react-virtualized are popular windowing libraries which provides several reusable components for displaying lists, grids, and tabular data.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you print falsy values in JSX?</h3>
<p>The falsy values such as false, null, undefined, and true are valid children but they don&#39;t render anything. If you still want to display them then you need to convert it to string. Let&#39;s take an example on how to convert to a string,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&lt;div&gt;
  My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}.
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the typical use case of portals?</h3>
<p>React portals are very useful when a parent component has overflow: hidden or has properties that affect the stacking context(z-index,position,opacity etc styles) and you need to visually “break out” of its container.</p>
<p>For example, dialogs, global message notifications, hovercards, and tooltips.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you set default value for uncontrolled component?</h3>
<p>In React, the value attribute on form elements will override the value in the DOM. With an uncontrolled component, you might want React to specify the initial value, but leave subsequent updates uncontrolled. To handle this case, you can specify a <strong>defaultValue</strong> attribute instead of <strong>value</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">render() {
  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;
        User Name:
        &lt;input
          defaultValue=&quot;John&quot;
          type=&quot;text&quot;
          ref={this.input} /&gt;
      &lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>The same applies for <code>select</code> and <code>textArea</code> inputs. But you need to use <strong>defaultChecked</strong> for <code>checkbox</code> and <code>radio</code> inputs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is your favorite React stack?</h3>
Even though the tech stack varies from developer to developer, the most popular stack is used in react boilerplate project code. It mainly uses Redux and redux-saga for state management and asynchronous side-effects, react-router for routing purpose, styled-components for styling react components, axios for invoking REST api, and other supported stack such as webpack, reselect, ESNext, Babel.
You can clone the project <a href="https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate">https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate</a> and start working on any new react project.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?</h3>
<p>Below are the main differences between Real DOM and Virtual DOM,</p>
<p>| Real DOM | Virtual DOM |
| ----- | ------- |
| Updates are slow | Updates are fast |
| DOM manipulation is very expensive. | DOM manipulation is very easy |
| You can update HTML directly. | You Can’t directly update HTML |
| It causes too much of memory wastage |     There is no memory wastage|
| Creates a new DOM if element updates | It updates the JSX if element update|</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li><h3>How to add Bootstrap to a react application?</h3>
<p>Bootstrap can be added to your React app in a three possible ways,</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the Bootstrap CDN:
This is the easiest way to add bootstrap. Add both bootstrap CSS and JS resources in a head tag.</li>
<li>Bootstrap as Dependency:
If you are using a build tool or a module bundler such as Webpack, then this is the preferred option for adding Bootstrap to your React application<pre><code class="lang-javascript">npm install bootstrap
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>React Bootstrap Package:
In this case, you can add Bootstrap to our React app is by using a package that has rebuilt Bootstrap components to work particularly as React components. Below packages are popular in this category,<ol>
<li>react-bootstrap</li>
<li>reactstrap</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can you list down top websites or applications using react as front end framework?</h3>
<p>Below are the <code>top 10 websites</code> using React as their front-end framework,</p>
<ol>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Uber</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>WhatsApp</li>
<li>Khan Academy</li>
<li>Airbnb</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>Flipboard</li>
<li>Netflix</li>
<li>PayPal</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is it recommended to use CSS In JS technique in React?</h3>
React does not have any opinion about how styles are defined but if you are a beginner then good starting point is to define your styles in a separate *.css file as usual and refer to them using className. This functionality is not part of React but came from third-party libraries. But If you want to try a different approach(CSS-In-JS) then styled-components library is a good option.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Do I need to rewrite all my class components with hooks?</h3>
No. But you can try Hooks in a few components(or new components) without rewriting any existing code. Because there are no plans to remove classes in ReactJS.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How to fetch data with React Hooks?</h3>
<p>The effect hook called <code>useEffect</code> is used to fetch the data with axios from the API and to set the data in the local state of the component with the state hook’s update function.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take an example in which it fetches list of react articles from the API</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">import React, { useState, useEffect } from &#39;react&#39;;
import axios from &#39;axios&#39;;

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({ hits: [] });

  useEffect(async () =&gt; {
    const result = await axios(
      &#39;http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=react&#39;,
    );

    setData(result.data);
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {data.hits.map(item =&gt; (
        &lt;li key={item.objectID}&gt;
          &lt;a href={item.url}&gt;{item.title}&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember we provided an empty array as second argument to the effect hook to avoid activating it on component updates but only for the mounting of the component. i.e, It fetches only for component mount.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Is Hooks cover all use cases for classes?</h3>
Hooks doesn&#39;t cover all use cases of classes but there is a plan to add them soon. Currently there are no Hook equivalents to the uncommon <strong>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate</strong> and <strong>componentDidCatch</strong> lifecycles yet.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the stable release for hooks support?</h3>
<p>React includes a stable implementation of React Hooks in 16.8 release for below packages</p>
<ol>
<li>React DOM</li>
<li>React DOM Server</li>
<li>React Test Renderer</li>
<li>React Shallow Renderer</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Why do we use array destructuring (square brackets notation) in <code>useState</code>?</h3>
<p>When we declare a state variable with <code>useState</code>, it returns a pair — an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that updates the value. Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.</p>
<p>For example, the array index access would look as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> var userStateVariable = useState(&#39;userProfile&#39;); // Returns an array pair
 var user = userStateVariable[0]; // Access first item
 var setUser = userStateVariable[1]; // Access second item
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas with array destructuring the variables can be accessed as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const [user, setUser] = useState(&#39;userProfile&#39;);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the sources used for introducing hooks?</h3>
<p>Hooks got the ideas from several different sources. Below are some of them,</p>
<ol>
<li>Previous experiments with functional APIs in the react-future repository</li>
<li>Community experiments with render prop APIs such as Reactions Component</li>
<li>State variables and state cells in DisplayScript.</li>
<li>Subscriptions in Rx.</li>
<li>Reducer components in ReasonReact.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you access imperative API of web components?</h3>
Web Components often expose an imperative API to implement its functions. You will need to use a <strong>ref</strong> to interact with the DOM node directly if you want to access imperative API of a web component. But if you are using third-party Web Components, the best solution is to write a React component that behaves as a <strong>wrapper</strong> for your Web Component.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is formik?</h3>
<p>Formik is a small react form library that helps you with the three major problems,</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting values in and out of form state</li>
<li>Validation and error messages</li>
<li>Handling form submission</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are typical middleware choices for handling asynchronous calls in Redux?</h3>
Some of the popular middleware choices for handling asynchronous calls in Redux eco system are <code>Redux Thunk, Redux Promise, Redux Saga</code>.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Do browsers understand JSX code?</h3>
No, browsers can&#39;t understand JSX code. You need a transpiler to convert your JSX to regular Javascript that browsers can understand. The most widely used transpiler right now is Babel.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Describe about data flow in react?</h3>
React implements one-way reactive data flow using props which reduce boilerplate and is easier to understand than traditional two-way data binding.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is react scripts?</h3>
The <code>react-scripts</code> package is a set of scripts from the create-react-app starter pack which helps you kick off projects without configuring. The <code>react-scripts start</code> command sets up the development environment and starts a server, as well as hot module reloading.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the features of create react app?</h3>
<p>Below are the list of some of the features provided by create react app.</p>
<ol>
<li>React, JSX, ES6, Typescript and Flow syntax support.</li>
<li>Autoprefixed CSS</li>
<li>CSS Reset/Normalize  </li>
<li>A live development server</li>
<li>A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting</li>
<li>A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps</li>
<li>An offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web App criteria.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of renderToNodeStream method?</h3>
The <code>ReactDOMServer#renderToNodeStream</code> method is used to generate HTML on the server and send the markup down on the initial request for faster page loads. It also helps search engines to crawl your pages easily for SEO purposes.
<strong>Note:</strong> Remember this method is not available in the browser but only server.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is MobX?</h3>
MobX is a simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution for applying functional reactive programming (TFRP). For reactJs application, you need to install below packages,<pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install mobx --save
npm install mobx-react --save
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the differences between Redux and MobX?</h3>
<p>Below are the main differences between Redux and MobX,</p>
<p>| Topic | Redux | MobX |
| ----- | ------- | ------- 
| Definition| It is a javascript library for managing the application state | It is a library for reactively managing the state of your applications |
| Programming | It is mainly written in ES6 | It is written in JavaScript(ES5) |
| Data Store | There is only one large store exist for data storage | There is more than one store for storage |
| Usage | Mainly used for large and complex applications | Used for simple applications |
| Performance | Need to be improved | Provides better performance |
| How it stores | Uses JS Object to store | Uses observable to store the data |</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Should I learn ES6 before learning ReactJS?</h3>
<p>No, you don’t have to learn es2015/es6 to learn react. But you may find many resources or React ecosystem uses ES6 extensively. Let&#39;s see some of the frequently used ES6 features,</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Destructuring:</strong> To get props and use them in a component</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> // in es 5
  var someData = this.props.someData
  var dispatch = this.props.dispatch

 // in es6
 const { someData, dispatch } = this.props
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Spread operator: Helps in passing props down into a component</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> // in es 5
 &lt;SomeComponent someData={this.props.someData} dispatch={this.props.dispatch} /&gt;

 // in es6
 &lt;SomeComponent {...this.props} /&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Arrow functions: Makes compact syntax<pre><code class="lang-javascript"> // es 5
 var users = usersList.map(function (user) {
  return &lt;li&gt;{user.name}&lt;/li&gt;
 })
 // es 6
 const users = usersList.map(user =&gt; &lt;li&gt;{user.name}&lt;/li&gt;);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is Concurrent Rendering?</h3>
<p>The Concurrent rendering makes React apps to be more responsive by rendering component trees without blocking the main UI thread. It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle a high-priority event. i.e, When you enabled concurrent Mode, React will keep an eye on other tasks that need to be done, and if there&#39;s something with a higher priority it will pause what it is currently rendering and let the other task finish first. You can enable this in two ways,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// 1. Part of an app by wrapping with ConcurrentMode
&lt;React.unstable_ConcurrentMode&gt;
  &lt;Something /&gt;
&lt;/React.unstable_ConcurrentMode&gt;

// 2. Whole app using createRoot
ReactDOM.unstable_createRoot(domNode).render(&lt;App /&gt;);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between async mode and concurrent mode?</h3>
Both refers the same thing. Previously concurrent Mode being referred to as &quot;Async Mode&quot; by React team. The name has been changed to highlight React’s ability to perform work on different priority levels. So it avoids the confusion from other approaches to Async Rendering.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>Can I use javascript urls in react16.9?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can use javascript: URLs but it will log a warning in the console. Because URLs starting with javascript: are dangerous by including unsanitized output in a tag like <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> and create a security hole.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const companyProfile = {
  website: &quot;javascript: alert(&#39;Your website is hacked&#39;)&quot;,
};
// It will log a warning
&lt;a href={companyProfile.website}&gt;More details&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that the future versions will throw an error for javascript URLs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the purpose of eslint plugin for hooks?</h3>
<p>The ESLint plugin enforces rules of Hooks to avoid bugs. It assumes that any function starting with ”use” and a capital letter right after it is a Hook. In particular, the rule enforces that,</p>
<ol>
<li>Calls to Hooks are either inside a PascalCase function (assumed to be a component) or another useSomething function (assumed to be a custom Hook).</li>
<li>Hooks are called in the same order on every render.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What is the difference between Imperative and Declarative in React?</h3>
<p>Imagine a simple UI component, such as a &quot;Like&quot; button. When you tap it, it turns blue if it was previously grey, and grey if it was previously blue.</p>
<p>The imperative way of doing this would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">if( user.likes() ) {
    if( hasBlue() ) {
        removeBlue();
        addGrey();
    } else {
        removeGrey();
        addBlue();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, you have to check what is currently on the screen and handle all the changes necessary to redraw it with the current state, including undoing the changes from the previous state. You can imagine how complex this could be in a real-world scenario.</p>
<p>In contrast, the declarative approach would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">if( this.state.liked ) {
    return &lt;blueLike /&gt;;
} else {
    return &lt;greyLike /&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because the declarative approach separates concerns, this part of it only needs to handle how the UI should look in a sepecific state, and is therefore much simpler to understand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>What are the benefits of using typescript with reactjs?</h3>
<p>Below are some of the benefits of using typescript with Reactjs,</p>
<ol>
<li>It is possible to use latest JavaScript features</li>
<li>Use of interfaces for complex type definitions</li>
<li>IDEs such as VS Code was made for TypeScript</li>
<li>Avoid bugs with the ease of readability and Validation</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><h3>How do you make sure that user remains authenticated on page refresh while using Context API State Management?</h3>
When a user logs in and reload, to persist the state generally we add the load user action in the useEffect hooks in the main App.js. While using Redux, loadUser action can be easily accessed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>App.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">import {lodUser}  from &#39;../actions/auth&#39;;
store.dispatch(loadUser());
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>But while using <strong>Context API</strong>, to access context in App.js, wrap the AuthState in index.js so that App.js can access the auth context. Now whenever the page reloads, no matter what route you are on, the user will be authenticated as <strong>loadUser</strong> action will be triggered on each re-render.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>index.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">import React from &#39;react&#39;;
import ReactDOM from &#39;react-dom&#39;;
import App from &#39;./App&#39;;
import AuthState from &#39;./context/auth/AuthState&#39;

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;AuthState&gt;
      &lt;App /&gt;
    &lt;/AuthState&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>App.js</strong></p>

<li><h3>What are the benefits of new JSX transform?</h3>
<p>There are three major benefits of new JSX transform,</p>
<ol>
<li>It is possible to use JSX without importing React packages</li>
<li>The compiled output might improve the bundle size in a small amount</li>
<li>The future improvements provides the flexibility to reduce the number of concepts to learn React.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><h3>How does new JSX transform different from old transform?</h3>
<p>The new JSX transform doesn’t require React to be in scope. i.e, You don&#39;t need to import React package for simple scenarios.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take an example to look at the main differences between the old and the new transform,</p>
<p><strong>Old Transform:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">import React from &#39;react&#39;;

function App() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Good morning!!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now JSX transform convert the above code into regular JavaScript as below,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">import React from &#39;react&#39;;

function App() {
  return React.createElement(&#39;h1&#39;, null, &#39;Good morning!!&#39;);
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>New Transform:</strong></p>
<p>The new JSX transform doesn&#39;t require any React imports</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">function App() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Good morning!!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Under the hood JSX transform compiles to below code</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">import {jsx as _jsx} from &#39;react/jsx-runtime&#39;;

function App() {
  return _jsx(&#39;h1&#39;, { children: &#39;Good morning!!&#39; });
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You still need to import React to use Hooks.</p>
